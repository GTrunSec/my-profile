/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:71:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:7:open-source Intel and you can't go too many conferences without seeing another talk on it and this lecture I may not talk about any sources that are particular new to you 
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:72:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:12: I'll also reference the knowledge base Wiki we talked about in the last election
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:73:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:17: now  osint can be almost anything that meets that criteria it could be a list of domains that are resolved to a specific IP address a list of malware hash is associated with Google search any of those pieces of information
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:75:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:25: so a few of these that you may be familiar with are on the screen here now virustotal is a and all outside the snow by Google that allows you to either submit the md5 hashes to see previous results 
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:76:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:31: and that's certainly not be relevant to your investigation domain and IP registration information so for instance the Whois domain registration information of how is domain names or the ownership information tied to IP ranges
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:78:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:39: example municate with a domain that is known to be evil he probably like the hope the alert would tell you why the domain is evil but in practice that often isn't the case it's unfortunate that's true but a lot of times you're going to be pulling into texting sources that don't lie provide that content
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:80:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:43:you're probably not going to be incredibly concerned about the alert since the reason it's on a bad list is because of the shared host environment however in another example what at the Domain was known to be owned by an attacker and was used 2.2 systems hosting malicious content in this case
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:81:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:45: going to be very concerned and will look for evidence of malware being downloaded by virtue of that relationship. they're not only that are Al some type of Suspicion now that was inside the contacts to an alert but outside the context of alert where the evidence would be here the malicious
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:83:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:57:and that's only the question you're always asking when you're clearing open source intelligence no matter what source or what type of those senior clearing that's the Common Thread
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:84:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:59: so now course several other questions will be derived from what you find that's a great thing but that's the common question I saw some of those I hope we are already digging into some of those and working on your own playlist what I want to do next is give you some strategies that will help you focus your efforts while doing osint research and seeking out answers to questions
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:85:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:61: that derive from other ocean research what's dig in a little bit on Focus questions related specific evidence top and what I want to do is actually give you an acronym that I developed a long time ago when I noticed a lot of analysts in a security operations center
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:87:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:69: Material out there about building security Labs but the vast majority of it is centered on building labs for penetration testing there's a lot to be learn there but the considerations for a network security monitoring lab are quite a bit different as offenders we have to worry about simulating and actual investigation environment capturing packet data and having the ability to run and monitor malicious software these tasks can be a bit daunting so it's easy to get scared away in this video on this lecture all simplify the process by providing a systematic approach to building your lab step-by-step once you're done you'll use your lab to test new signatures you've written do triage malware samples and and to see what logs are generated when certain behaviors occur for example what does an RDP logon look like to a Windows server at the packet level and at the Windows login level these are important questions to Defender use my lab nearly every and the same can be said for most of the forensic analyst oftentimes having access to a good lab makes a difference between a good analyst and a mediocre one if all or part of your job revolves around investigating alerts performing hunting or some type of investigation then the lab is a must we aren't talking about just running desktop virtualization software and creating a few vmc or there that's something that's very nice to have in use but it isn't a lap a lab is Hallmark by being and isolated environment where you don't have to worry about contaminating the data you collect with extraneous data related to your normal system this lecture is all about creating a lab that is more formalized patient in support of your investigation activities in this video will start with outline some different goals of an NSM lab one-size-fits-all so it's important to think about what you want to get out of the lab for you Planning and Building in front loading this part of the work will pay dividends towards the middle and end of the process once you know what you want it's time to decide on an architecture physical virtual and cloud-based labs diagrams of each top you can work from this step is important because it's where will Define the flow of traffic and how you captured unless you're going with a pure cloud-based solution you'll need some Hardware to run your infrastructure I'll discuss considerations there and make some recommendations from my own lab after that will dive into the software you need to run your lab this one clue. Operating systems and NSM software and here I'll cover the different system roles are recommend having in a lab based upon I'm done in the earlier planning stages of the process I'll describe boy with all the knowledge you need to get started building your lab in a few diagrams and temples that you can work from keep in mind that I'm not just going to throw out a bunch of random Loosely related suggestions what about this video is about taking a systematic approach to design in developing your lab much in the same way that a network administrator would designer real Network the most part what you're creating here important Eufaula every step here if you skip something you might get further down the line and end up getting lost are the materials presented here was carefully chosen to get you to a place highly functional NSM lab that meets all your needs defrauding details in my own personal lab including a complete parts list and network diagram couple of other network diagrams you can use a starting point as well as can be found in the resources link provided with this video again I'll be showing you exactly what I run in my own lab this is the exact Lab at sitting next to me on the table as we speak now that's to say that my lab may not be the perfect setup for everybody that works for my needs and I think various iterations on it will work for yours probably as well
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:88:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:72: the first really critically important thing I want to talk about is setting the goals for your lab if you're an innocent man was most of your lab work will probably fall into one of three categories signature development malware analysis and simulations development is something most analyst do to feed the detection mechanisms that generate alerts within their environment horse out of this is usually going to be with more signature-based intrusion detection systems like snort cercado some cases Advanced side you might be using custom scripts within the Bro framework for building a tuning signatures I just want to learn more about it then you're going to want systems deployed with all these Technologies even if you're just responsible for validating investigating alerts it's helpful to have these tools available so you can replay traffic through them to make sure that the results you're getting are expected it's not uncommon for an analyst to get a peek at from a source outside your monitoring visibility window and want to replay it through a detection mechanism to see if anything alerts is all very important things now while it may take awhile for newer analysts to get to this point eventually also need to be able to understand what a particular piece of malware does what its capabilities are what its potential is the different nasty effects of can have on your system level you want to take a suspicious file and throw it into a sand box for basic static in behavioral analysis Google for determining if malware has been installed on a system and for building signatures based on newly discovered samples skilled you might want to use your lab to conduct your own manual static and behavioral analysis to dive deeper as well suffered in many cases you won't know if something is anomalous until you can compare it to something normal this is perhaps the greatest value in having a lab because it gives you a place to stand up normal systems introduce a stimulus and review the response scenario where you observe a system sending a lot of weird-looking Skype John Skype user in might otherwise be hard to find a sample to prepare what the traffic is online you know you don't know what a normal Skype traffic looks like and even if you did if you did run Skype it may be difficult to separate that out from the normal traffic you running on your system and that can certainly be very time-consuming what system in your lab you can stall Skype and quickly generate the sample for comparison and kind of an isolated scenario without a bunch of extra data or variables great deal investigating security alerts is all about being able to discern what is normal versus what is abnormal in addition to this you can also conduct simulations of attacks abilities releasing you need to stand up a vulnerable system in a day do this in your lab just as an attacker with the information of Czar from the attack you can build detection based upon the traffic captured log generated and operating system this is a very common workflow in most organizations she hasn't evolved such to a point yet where as soon as a new vulnerabilities announced the detection is being announced with it right so in this case listen to your lab run it run the simulation and see what that is generated then you could build a signature out of it this is something most reasonably secure secure and will do so you should spend some time considering your job role in which of these scenarios you're most likely to spend your time doing they're all related to some degree simulations are used to tune signatures and malware analysis is a form of stimulation when doing Behavior Analysis very interrelated and you may do very little of one and much of another or you may do very little of all these things with important to understand what your workflow is and where the lab can help you in these endeavors another way to think about this by considering your expected in
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:89:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:77: your job is probably defined by the type of data you take as an input and the desire to Outline Three really common input and output scenarios that I think irrelevant to most analysts first most famous responsible for reviewing alerts done this at some point some of you may do this exclusively or some of you may do it just as a small part of your job but you may need to take an alert that's that comes from a signature-based IDs or some form of Sommore next-gen firewall or something like that take that alert and run it to ground do your investigation she really wanted to determine one is the alert a true positive false positive I certainly was a true positive then you want to escalate that and act on it and then you know too if the false positive you probably need to be there you know Builder tunes on top of a signature to prevent that from happening again and optimize your time so in this case the alert is your input and either this disposition or a tomb signature is probably your output the goal of the lab is to help you get from input to Output better or quicker and in this case it's probably going to take the form of some type of stimulation they would allow you to do that in a second scenario your handed a packet capture file as your input need to make a determination on whether it's malicious another disposition type judgment and whether you need to build a tuna signature I need might be handed a peacock for a number of reasons you know outside of the scope of your normal centigrade in your normal detection I might come from from place you just don't have a sensor or might be from a sensor where something was missed but you needed to catch it and so you're replaying that pcap through through new technology and given to you by a client and that way so in this case the lab pills are all providing you the ability to replay the pcap through your sensors in various detection mechanisms to get to the output you want the third scenario have here is some of the last been sitting behind a packet capture being handed an actual file and again you want to determine a disposition is it malicious is a malware or is it been on and then what you do that you make a decision about whether you need to build a tuna signature to catch the catch this type of file catch a better maybe like a Yaris signature or something like that is it opposed to after-the-fact so just take the lab provides a role that will allow you to detonate that found a Sandbox to Canada achieved the desired output you want there the gist of this is that if you can identify your comment inputs and outputs then you should be well-equipped to figure out what rolls your lab can feel to help you get from input to Output which is really important Juniper use examples of outline the model you can use to plan out your lab again we want a front load the planning work here so the actual work of building the lab goes much smoother if you don't do this you're really run yourself a risk of getting overwhelmed during the the process of purchasing a hardware or building out the lab itself and really never
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:91:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:79: get it done this what happens to most people I see is they just they just get into it and they get really overwhelmed because they didn't do the planning ahead of time and that can really affect your ability to it to get through this and it's certainly some work to get the lab planned and built up once you do it's so valuable and will really be helpful to you in your daily job and really for advancing your career in your education as well so you're fighting yourself and your own psychological limitations here as much as anything else to to get this bill so the framework early requires you ask yourself 3 fairly simple questions what inputs do you receive do you simply review alerts or do you have to perform analysis of peak apps and files from internal external sources second what outputs are you expected produce is your job only to determine if alerts weren't escalation or you involved in the creation of two native detection mechanisms as well at this point it's also worth considering whether you're responsible for just a single network network of the organization you work for or if you're working for some type of consultancy where you're required to provide maybe some more detailed report and recommendations and things like that those are outputs you should consider finally what technologies are needed to get you from inputs that you've identified to the output you need this one click specific Technologies like intrusion detection systems operating systems malware analysis tools data collection and Analysis tools and more and also if you're basing your lab off of your production Network you should try to mirror those Technologies in your lab really as much as possible remember that part of your goal is to create a representative sample of the network you're defending that's where the science of this kind of comes into play when you're finished listing the technology needed in your lab you should be able to bruselas like this example
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:92:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:80:*** Technology example list
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:93:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:81: I've shown here on the screen now in this example this we see that will need several different tools and operating systems available to cover the range of use cases that will support our work so in this case we see a lot of popular detection related Technologies like snort netsniff-ng for packet capture bro silk for flow capture a cuckoo sandbox for malware detonation of Behavioral analysis a couple of analysis tools like squeal to look at various alerts flow bat to dig into netflow traffic from systems generally going to be design I replicate things that are in the production environment that we're working from or really just that things are interested in knowing more a few different varieties of the Windows operating system Windows domain controller so in that case you can actually create your own domain and examine traffic between the domain controller and domain domain clients as well as and the lamp Linux Apache web server so a lot of variety here through this portion of the exercise to make your own similar list in general actually recommend doing that first even maybe even before watching the rest of this video I've provided a worksheet in the resources section that you can use to make a list similar to this this one that I have here this example  no first really big implementation decision that you'll need to make will be related to the architecture platform you're using namely will you build your lab with physical devices virtual machines or the virtual cloud images voices has their own pros and cons so let's review those platform option you have to consider is a physical lab that relies on Hardware being built represent a fully functional Network this is probably that use case that most people might jump to first because of course this represents what you're used to think about when you think of a real functional net worth buying physical computers and servers installing operating systems systems as well as purchasing installing networking gear Lycra you're actually in this case literally building a real Network right I know this has the benefits of allowing you to learn Concepts they can apply to real Network management which is certainly a plus and it can also provide flexibility to reconfigure the network by physically plugging and unplugging Hardware in at different places to change the network topology apart can be a plus or minus depending on where your interests lie now imagine the biggest drawbacks here in terms of flexibility and cost you can find cheaper low and Hardware pretty easily on eBay or in local auctions that cost can still out up really quickly especially if you need to run several versions of modern Windows operating systems which need I've been some of the junk you literally found at a thrift store down if you have to rebuild the operating system of physical machine from time to time for instance if you're running malware generally when you run malware you're going to want some type of snapshot and capability so that you can revert to before the matter was executed and not have to rebuild the operating system every time I would have standard physical machine some others have a backup option but I really would be very time-consuming and not to feasible machines don't provide any type of Snapchat if you mess something up or are need xq malware all the physical lab maybe that's the first thing that comes to mind for a lot of people I can't think of many actual use cases were physical lab would make the most sense it's just not really very cost-effective doesn't give you the flexibility you need certainly simpler if you're familiar with real Network architecture design but again I just can't think of any use cases where you would want to do that so for that reason in this video we're not really going to talk about physical labs the next platform option you have to consider
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:94:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:83: is through a cloud provider there a lot of cloud providers out there now Amazon web services AWS for starting the biggest Microsoft provides is your Rackspace has their own cloud offering and that certainly makes one option for deploying a lab this technology allows you to deploy systems based on Virtual images of either vanilla or pre-configured operating systems play pre-configured operating system to start cuz it can increase your efficiency Nobu to server you can deploy in a boon to server running nodejs in mongodb already freaking figure sets time you're not having to spend doing that yourself which is certainly valuable and unique benefit to to Cloud base lab is essentially the model will vary depending upon the the provider for the most part your pain based upon their resources your allocating to these machine with some multiple of the resources there and then you paid based upon your actual nothing employee system in a cloud-based environment You're simply choosing an operating system image selecting the processing disc and memory resources you'll need providing a few basic pieces of identity information depressing go right it's as simple as that the machine is usually built in a matter of seconds and you can log into it as soon as it's it's built as it were a normal device because you can bring systems up and down so quickly a cloud-based lab probably the greatest degree of flexibility in that regard which is one of the main reasons parts of their infrastructure they need to rapidly expand or contract based upon changing infrastructure needs things like a web infrastructure high peak times are in Peak demand seasons which cloud provider has their own unique cost model but most of them center around paying for based upon resources you need for individual lab systems usually don't need a gigantic systems this cost shouldn't get too out of hand with just a few systems if you're building a reasonably sized lab call even for most normal folks then it cost can increase pretty rapidly in cases like that the cloud lab will probably end up costing you more than a Virtual Lab which a Virtual Lab but we'll talk about next but it's important to understand that that cost relationship there because of the cloud lab is certainly a continual cost so you'll you'll be paying for it for the most part on day one is much as you'll be paying for it on day you know 500 I know it's worth mentioning that one of the bigger sticking points with cloud-based Labs is that their networking options are limited specifically most providers don't give you a mechanism for capturing packets from a group of devices that's what the normal Network you know you ever a switch with a span port and you would run things through that switch it would it would span the port disconnecting the Upstream router and then you would get everything going Upstream you don't have that option with in the cloud there that'll make Cloud TAPS in most cases they may eventually but right now so that means package on its own local to those individual machines this is a couple problems with this I never wanted that increases the storage footprint of those machines that you act restoring increase your cost if you have to go around every individual machine to collect all the package you want we had it certainly going to decrease your efficiency there and appreciate your desire to use the lab now we're running loud exploits is a part of a simulation as the malware processes in the XY code May render the target system inaccessible running a packet capture on a machine and then you run an export against it and it crashes machine you're not going to have a good ability to get the packets out of it you're going to lose those and that's that's not a good scenario so or really time of Engagement if you just have a short reason you need to set up something and try something without a lot of advanced networking needs cloud looks great that said it's still not what I use it's not what I would recommend for the most General use case I'm generally going to prefer a Virtual Lab which is what we'll talk about next and focus on for the rest of this video last but not least is the option for a virtual platform which is by far the most popular in using in the labs in the folks I know have labs and it's definitely what I recommend for for the vast majority of folks talk about really for the rest of this video is the process of Designing a Virtual Lab because I really believe it's it's probably the best and most cost-effective option
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:95:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:85: at a small scale you can setup a Virtual Lab by installing what's called a type 2 hypervisor like VMware Workstation or Fusion on an existing system that will I didn't create virtual systems that you install an operating system on to interact with him like you would have big physical system that works fine how large are more long-term scenarios and data collection primarily because of limited resources available on the desktop and the potential to contaminate your data collection with normal traffic we kind of hit up on this a bit earlier that's not really a lab it's way too quickly run things up and you can certainly run simulations and and run some detection that way but it's really not the most ideal scenario for First Estate isolation there so for your lab you'll actually most mostly be concerned with what we call type 1 hypervisor like VMware esxi are xenserver in this scenario you install these platforms onto a bare-metal system with the sole purpose of Hosting virtual machines so you don't necessarily install an operating system like Windows and then install the software on top of it the software like being where he has sex to the physical machine it's the only operating system in the virtual machines are then posted from give me about virtual server host is that they are the benefit of being incredibly flexible and also very cheap you can build a virtual host for lab purposes It's very effective for you know around $8,500 at the low in which we need a lot of folks needs and even with that $500 system once it's built you can host dozens of virtual systems on them and so here in a bit I'll give you an example of such a system that they can be built in the resources section include a list of what I've built in my network now the Virtual Lab you can build new systems in a matter of minutes and then you can bring those systems up or down based upon your needs at a given time with with minimal effort so especially monitoring top systems but I know in the case of mine I probably have 50 to 60 virtual machines and I just bring the ones I need to use up or down at any given instant so the way the resources are allocated for the most part I'm not using the available resources unless the machine is running which is a great deal of flexibility and very useful so in addition to this virtual Labs Rod probably the most flexible form of of snapshotting that's available to you you can actually create snapshots with a single click so if you decide you want a snapshot click one button it creates it and you can also restore it with just a couple clicks there you can even create snapshot trees and have multiple Forks of a single virtual machine in different states this is really useful for simulations as well as malware analysis you can create a snapshot snapshot image of the crazies big Laboratories basically the state of a system through many different iterations of of events that may be occurring on it which is incredibly useful I can't I can't overstate how useful that is so you're not having to redo work all the time it's really great now there are only two real drawbacks to Virtual Labs I think was mentioning first is that the platforms themselves sometimes have a bit of a learning curve something like VMware esxi server like it does take a little bit to learn a little bit of how that works and how to get that set up and going it's not too bad but there is one second and the other real drawback is that there's more of an initial upfront investment with a need to purchase the hardware to service the virtual Host this is different than a cloud model you created with Virtual Lab do you have to invest the initial upfront cost for the physical host as well as a couple of networking components routers and switches you'll need to setup your monitoring within the scope of your eye your existing Network always recommended Virtual Lab for the purposes of the defensive security practitioner and the rest of this video I'll Focus exclusively on building a virtual lab and that'll include the consideration she need going forward from a hardware and software perspective as well as some recommendations on different platforms and exact steps you should go through to build your lab and kind of a systematic way that will ensure success of the end of the UN allowed that will be great for your own needs virtual Labs that should help you we start speaking out the hardware you're going to need for your Virtual Lab you should start by drawing it out on paper now you don't need to spend a lot of time making it very pretty and getting all the colors riding Alliance trading something like Vizio but you should at least put something down on a white border in a notebook everything where I wanted and wild boars really conducive to that I want you finalize it later you can make it pretty in and do the Vizio so to do this I recommend three three fairly simple steps start from the internet and move inward or Downstream most of your probably gonna be building your Virtual Lab at home so apologies probably pretty simple you probably have just a single modem or router or maybe their combined but this is probably as simple as starting by drawing a you known as fluffy cloud the internet and drawing a line from it to your external router and then from there you can you can move in work and draw lines were things connect we start drawing things out this is where the list you created earlier really comes into play if you remember you should have created a list that basically had every technology and service that you're going to need in your lab your next task is to Production Service you have listed there and put it into your diagram as if it were a physical system in a real Network you can place eat service individually to start with or if you know where you want to combine things you can certainly do that where make sense Branson's if you know you'll be running a web server and a sequel server those theoretically could obviously and you can have to decide if that makes sense for you or if you want them separate for instance if you want to capture packets going in between them to represent something that maybe on your real system as another example of something like security onion to have all your monitoring Technologies like that's if Angie and snort and bro or you can have those separately as well if you think your you have a good know what you figure out where called consolidation can exist your next step is to draw the network connections in a way that is conducive to the data you want to capture this could be as simple as grouping all your virtual systems together in a flat Network and configuring your sensors to intercept traffic between those systems and the internet and how to divide your systems in the multiple networks so you can play sensors that can capture traffic between Network segments as well as between them and the network and the internet this of course is going to represent them more real world Network children all this out you should have an architecture map basic crating architecture map that you can use to build your network not loading to work when you get to the process actually building networking had reference the process should go really really quickly shortly will go to the process of setting that up but let's the Torso get a couple of examples so as
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:96:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:87: and I said starting out will jar network from the outside working in word again if you're doing this at home your network diagram is probably look as simple as this right you have the internet you have your router and that's your start very easy next going to take all the things from our list and then this is based on the list we used in the earlier slide and place all the systems that are needed in this case I have 3 servers and three clients I've done some some consolidation in that regard and then these are all the other production systems right so we haven't got to the monitoring infrastructure so that's next finally here we're going to modify the network designed to account for the monitoring technology we need and make sure that's reflected example we done quite a bit of consolidation on the sensor side and again we can probably do something like security onion to achieve this level of consolidation I hear all the virtual machines are plugged into a switch that is marrying the traffic between them in the router to the sensors find a cuckoo sandbox device as well so this is the simplest way to design a lab you know keep in mind everything you see here other than the router and switch exist on a single piece of hardware on the single virtual host that includes the sensors the cuckoo sandbox and all of the servers and clients we have available so this is probably for most home users doing doing a symbol now considering the same set of requirements this is an example of how the same lab could be designed in a much more advanced than kind of dispersed way again we're working from the same list but we've lay things out more real world so to speak here we place the web and mail servers and they demilitarized zone the DMZ that separated from the domain controller in the clients to support this we have an extra router and switch a series of sensors sensors which have been broken out into more individual virtual machines based upon their roles is really more similar to an actual corporate production network based on the way things are segregated out Atmore granularity and dealing with Individual Services and how you can track data moving through the network however this can be accomplished with a single virtual host to the lab setup I run at my house but just level complexity Main most after all with more complex ability does come warm engine overhead and this case you'll need to purchase a few extra pieces of network Hardware as well so this is going to up your cost a little bit too one more final note on network is on here for most of you you'll probably building your lab Network at home many of you will probably just use your lab Network functionally as your home network as well and that's mostly fine but you want more segregation you'll need to do that at that the height Upstream level you can so for example in my network pay my eyes p a few extra bucks a month and they give me a range of static IP addresses this allows me to take my my Broadband modem and plug two different routers into it and get two different static IP addresses I have my home network Downstream from one router and my lab Downstream from another router if I need to do something on the lab Network I can just physically plug a laptop into that Network or join the wireless network I have set up avail so you can get on that so for me for my purposes I wanted to have that complete level of segregation but for most that might not be an issue motion may just want to run it independently again you want to make sure you have at least enough segregation to make sure your local browsing traffic isn't polluting the network after you're taking for you this is just another way to to get to the goal of having a more flexible lab now that you know what your lab network will look like it's time to start speaking up
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:97:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/ELK/DATA-in-ES.org:3:This lesson really going to start and diving into elasticsearch Hands-On into talk about all the basic action only want to take related to any database and that's what we call crud which stands for create read update and deletes I'm going to go through examples of all these dealing exclusively with elasticsearch now if you remember from earlier I mentioned that elasticsearch provides restful API access and that's an important concept to understand as we begin to interact with elastic search for the really defines the way in which we interact with the data that we have stored in our database database and we're going to interact with it with an HTTP client we say something is restful that means were interacting with HTTP M Points so if you're familiar with how HTTP works and if your insecurities you're probably are to some degree we have this concept of request methods and response codes that means we will make a request in this case we can make a get request for the root directory of the web server and the server is responsible for responding to that request hopefully for our purposes is the 200 okay status code along with the data we requested so the fact that we're using HTTP client really opens up a lot of doors for some reason people like developing Tools around elasticsearch so much that's really easy that a lot of blackberries out there that can be used for interacting with things play Piazza just an easy way to interact with data now in H-E-B client of course can be a lot of things one of those things is curling that's what we did in the example earlier when we set up elasticsearch and tested to make sure it worked we used to curl and requested the root directory 2 / of the elasticsearch instance to verify that was responding and it was so curl is a text-based httpclient quiet is a browser so Chrome isn't even over browser I could very simply put the address of the elastic search database into my browser and requested and get information that way and that's another way to go beyond that we have web applications that we can use so by using our browser and using Chrome we can use something like kamana which we can issue commands to and then it will take our request interpret those format them appropriately for elasticsearch and request that at War insert dad or someone we can use it for all of the credit functionality week read update and delete data off of these Russell interaction so if you not dealt with a lot of restful interaction than this may seem kind of new to you that's fine we're about to get into some examples using this right now I'm dialed into my elk server here and I just want to make sure
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:98:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/ELK/DATA-in-ES.org:6:that elasticsearch is up and running so I'm going to go ahead and do PS aux and grip for that and it does look like elasticsearch is running a little bit here too so I want to make sure it's running I'm sure enough it looks like it is also make sure that these things are listening on the network just by doing that's that Dash antp went to see what we have here it does look like yes we have Port 9200 running locally so that's elasticsearch 5601 listening as well so that is for cabanis all those things are running which means we should be good to go as far as using and interacting with elasticsearch & Gabbana kabana remember we not done anything to this instance I like going on so if I go up here and go to the Discover section where I would generally expect to be able to run a search up here it says index patterns please specify a default index pattern and that he is unable to fetch mapping do you have in this in this these matching the pattern part of this and we'll see the same similar messages getting any data being kicked to this man configure an index pattern page and the reason for that is because we don't have any data in here yet there's nothing for it to show so come on is only useful if there's data in our database that we can enter 8 through so if we want to get data in here we have to manually put it in or you some other third-party application wish we had to manually put that in so you can understand a little bit of this structure of how these working how were putting and getting them from the elastic search index not to do that we're going to go here to this Dev tools option and we have a very simple console organ input commands hit display button and get the results of those right there this is what we're going to focus on here for the next little bit and you already seen me run or testing to make sure elasticsearch was installed properly is flash just going to request the root directory of the web introduce some outputs I'm going to go ahead and hit this we do get response back from elasticsearch so we know we are connected to elasticsearch nor able to interact with it this is some very basic output the last search for buys just about the cluster name the uid version and information and so on so there's not a lot here that's useful to us in terms of data we're going to search and do something with data now to do that we're going to use command which is an HTTP method is used to upload data to a server and we're going to use it to put data into our elasticsearch instance here and we do this as take a very specific format going to list the name of the index we want to certain that's insert data into I'm going to choose our athletes index building off of a previous example we talked to her from there we have to list the type that we are putting the data into ruin indexes and then we have types so I'm going to insert a basketball player in here so I'm going to go for the basketball type from there I'm going to specify a unique identifier for the document for which I'm just going to use the identifier one I can make this multiple digits I can actually even leave it off and a random identifier would be assigned but for this purpose I'm going to go ahead and Assad and identifier here the important that's the header string here where I'm saying that I want to put a document into at the athletes index the basketball type and a sign of the number one the identifier one I need to actually put the document that I want to answer so I'm going to go ahead and paste this in here this is again from a previous example notices this is Json format it so we begin our object with curly braces and end with curly braces and then we have a list of keyvaluepair so we have the field last name and the value Curry the first name field and that you stepped in some once we have five Fields were inserting here now this is properly formatted that you may have seen pop-up noticed that if I just put a random character here I get an error that it expected something different so I'll give her that everything looks good and I'll hit the play button get back his response from elasticsearch which tells me that this was essentially successful and it goes back to me the index which is athletes the type which is basketball the ID which is one and a little bit of other metadata one is version number of the document that I just answered if it's a brand new documents of the number is 1 the result tells me this was created I got a little information about shards elasticsearch management feature that would make her a little bit later and then I finally get created equals true so know that this was successfully inserted into the database and that data should know actually exist for me to ask to access the data we're going to change things around a little bit first of all I can get rid of the document I just inserted I don't need that anymore put HTTP method I'm going to change it to get I remember we used it earlier to get the information and tested the elastic search are results going to tell it to get use the same format get / index / type / ID if I hit the play button on this we get the results back and we get the data we just insert it we have submitted out of here we have index athletes type basketball id-1 version one we have and output that says found is true so that the data was actually found and then we had this underscore Source object here where and we get the actual document we inserted so this is that same Player information Define an object's this is within a bigger object bigger object contains the metadata about are searching about the index and type and the internal object is actually the document we were searching for so that's that gives us the data we want and what we can do here as well as I can add another / here and your score Source input and noticed that's the name of this song never hit play only going to get the Json document we're not going to get all of that we're going to get this specific object related to the data we have started we're not going to get all that other and depending on what the output goal of your searches this may be something that you you're using for for whatever reason but that's the underscore Source input to get the data we just inserted and only that. what does it look like if we search for data that maybe doesn't actually exist in our index at a trot so here I'm going to do it but instead of ID one which we know exist for the ID to within the basketball type in the athletes index we get a response back so you actually get data back but in this case it echoes back our index are type in our ID and tells us found is false and no other data is so that's why we have to work with me know that Paxil for programmatically Keen off of that for some reason weekend similarly we can we get some more responses back at some grief we search for maybe an index that doesn't exist so if I search for the DFI are index and hit plate weed a little bit more data but it basically equates to the fact that there is no index found here so we see we have an error we have recalls information index not found exception no such index a little bit more information at go back to us and we actually even get a 404 status Air which is akin to Dad and I found our file not found in HTTP Response Code went so back to you when you search for something or try to retrieve data that does not actually exist now we just tried to search for ID too and it didn't exist so it's actually go ahead and practice inserting data One More Time by creating specify are athletes index to notice how Cabana is actually Auto feeling that for us now that it knows that index exist I'm going to do put into athletes indexed to our basketball type Heidi too and will taste in here are next document which is John Wall the point guard for the Washington Wizards rated truths we know that data was inserted successfully so let's go ahead and Echo that data back by changing this put to agate I turned off we get the data back we can also go ahead and add this Source in point and just get the actual data without the metadata associated with it so here once again we're able to index data into elasticsearch and then retrieve that data back talk about updating data in this case let's say that John Wall who plays for Washington gets traded will say he gets traded to I don't know Dallas
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:99:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/ELK/DATA-in-ES.org:9: 2 watt to accomplish this 215 here is where making a pope pushed to the update in point for the athletes index basketball type id2 and then were specifying the field we want to change which is here is if it's if we go back to the previous exams are documents that reindexed want to make a settled and that one's going to be pretty straightforward so let's say we've been working with object ID number to hear which is this John Wall basketball player so what we're actually going to do is delete him so we don't want him in our index in and execute that it's going to tell us that the item was found it's going to go back to the index type and ID to us in the version the result is that this was deleted and delete was successful and we can verify that by changing delete to get and sure enough found is now false we know this was actually properly deleted that data no longer exist that particular ID was deleted and doesn't exist in this index anymore HTTP method can be used quite a bit more aggressively what you sow I want thing we can do is we can actually delete our entire athletes index in this is probably not something you're going to be doing a lot of is deleting entire Nexus released in this course where you're playing around with things you messed up I want to be able to do so I'm going to delete our athletes index here and noticed that it says acknowledged true in this case so let's go ahead and verify let's try to get the athletes saw the basketball type and ID one which is one week individually deleted now tell us indexes not found and that's because the the index has been deleted it's no longer there so we're back to where we started where in there is no data in this elasticsearch in set for back now one of the trick that might come in handy for you to question I'll get asked a lot as well how do I list all the available in to see them not finding the data I want I want to make sure mine this Seas well that's a pretty easy one of theirs and .44 that as well so I'm going to do get underscore cat which is just basic in a list out specific features of certain I'm going to tell it to cat out the you hear when I play in this case the only to see that exist as the actual. Kabana one which is the default one that comes the gets installed when you configure a cabanis there actually no other in to see if there were other ones those would show up so that's actually go ahead and recreate are in to see here for athletes I'm going to go ahead and put this in here and we for recreated are athletes miss a notice our version starts back at number one because it's a new index that document have been deleted so it's not going to be incrementing versions in that case get the list of indices again we now have our athletes Embassy here with all the associated metadata a Twitter that that is now available to us know that about wraps up here but I do want to show you one more thing just a circle back to something I talked about earlier about how when are using restful apis are a lot of different ways to with something like elasticsearch and we've been doing that to the browser here with kabana but we can actually go back and do that with curl as well and I just want to show a quick example in a way that you can actually get those commands made for you very easily and I'm going to go ahead and show you something we already looked at clearing the ID number one which is one of our athletes we've been started into this index what I'm going to do now is click this Carl I'm going to click that and after I do that I'm going to switch over to our command line here and I'm going to paste this in so this is what was copied and it should look familiar this is how we tested elasticsearch using curl - x get good as the method and its case it's specifying base of the same thing we just queried but with the appropriate connection string enter here and we get the exact same result back that we got back lactation the same command but we're not browser and this to show you how easy it is interact with so many tools are built on top of it you can very easily write a python script that could do this and really rot a hole analysis tool kit from a python from very simple Python scripts that just use existing HTTP libraries to interact with an elastic search database the TV is interacting with a typical relational database such as I see cooler or something like that and maybe even depend on your perspective a little bit easier than that so probably this lesson has been really helpful to you as we've gone through and looked at all of these different types of interactions starting to interact with and get her hands dirty on with using elasticsearch pop-up this first really Hands-On lecture we've had with elasticsearch we learned a lot of the core things that we're going to build on through the rest of Ichabod and from there we did basic crud operations of data data

We don't have tags no it's all gone and conversely we could actually do that for all of these and just completely clean this up and just have the bare minimum of what we know we're getting values back for and beyond that not lose much sleep over it very powerful thing to do what we also going to do is so let's look here we have refers right and we have some that don't have her first maybe we only care about maybe the network say we're looking at we only care about H-E-B connections that have a refer and so we're going to do is add the predicate the filter press Chase HP info record because that matches it up with the log idea of HDPE calm calm and if the record exists this will violate to true and false true and true else return false if you want to keep the row the line of data we with a Vlog we were turn true that keeps it otherwise return false and that gets rid of it so if we look at so we're going to filter the refer the referred is not exist let's Scroll of it right here so that means this first entry should be gone because there is no refer that means this entry should be gone 3 so there's a handful and as we look through here and go ahead and run and we should not see the very first entry because of her fur does not exist right it is gone here we don't see anything that is not which is very very helpful right but conversely let's say we want to that doesn't have a refer so will negate that we should only see entries have no refer alright these are all the entries that sometimes looking at the negative side of what your initial e looking at actually gives you the results you're you want keep that in mind as you go through here sometimes negating something will give you the data you actually want something to compare and contrast two which is and just as helpful conversely King on the ACP log for hdb log what if we only want the timestamp to uid the year I we want to exclude Clute that's a set and we want that timestamp ID URI and nothing else that's all we want over ICP maybe it's a special pcap they were looking at just very specific things and we only have those things that we were after it's a very very very powerful thing to have very helpful so that gives you a flavor of the logging capabilities at bro as a review of them I should say but it actually gives you Jerry you of what you can do for logging when you're logging you don't have to settle with what you're just being given you can actually down select you have a path variables to be able to send data to different files you can down select you can compute those paths you can bulk change them yeah probably gets to filter and exclude specific line items and you can have sets that include specific columns or exclude specific columns definitely all things to experiment with try bro is a great resource to do that in because you can click about and find the details before you actually start implementing lunch sensor so effective a free playground environment there is no harm in doing that actually it's a great approach in general examples in the previous I showed you the templates calculate the templates to lease start out with the look through if you understand how to pull and find records a filled-in records excuse me then filter and becomes very straightforward the existence of a record or the non-existence of a field in a record scuse me enlarged where your filtering comes in certain interval ranges of that data is the other side of it we I did show previously the connection threshold I showed filtering and talked about filtering ahead of this section just to give you another layered example of the filtering capabilities that is a big one at this point the the cart before the horse because fairly easy because the sections built on top of each other it's hard to show them in the proper order because you want to build a bill do certain sections and show the is between sections of why they exist necessitates that hat but this was the filtering section demonstration for brow and hopefully it gives you a really good idea of some very quick very straightforward ways of cleaning up your logs reducing the volume of your logs again it's great to put on everything you start getting the point of turning things off and down that's when the real work starts that's what filtering let you achieve in a very timely fashion and a very Dynamic way

just are less you're trying to do some statistical analysis you may not use this ever but for familiarity purposes I don't want you to be aware they exist vectors allow for duplicate entries in the introduction to sat I said they cannot actors do their very fast make some allows for some optimizations if you're trying to collect up I mean can that that bad actor IP address did something against a specific Port umbrella today you can use a vector to collect those up so over this this window of time event happened 500 times based on me collecting up their IP address let's say into this vector Adam all up never nice summation functions go through have it all up pronounce results analysis doctors are you're going to want to go to use demonstration of vectors and bro and how to manipulate them add to them and deal with them now we're going to start again with bro in it credit local verb it is a type vector and in order to send text her back to her so you say it's a vector but it's a vector of what Vector of count after string Vector outer Vector of potentially something along those lines what's it what's to a vector of count and that alone is enough to initialize a vector that is a vector just ran no errors you're going to probably have some kind of initialization and that is very handy to have we will do this so now we know to better account similar to a set using curly brackets and now it should be a vector of 4 Prius 1 2 3 4 but remember a vector is is indexed zero based indexing initializing a vectors handy is you have to know the length of the vector have to know the size of the vector and if you're going to add things to the vector nuances to that ways to do that is to Simply go in so will say vector and we're going to go to the length of the vector set that equal to 5 and that's how you add into a vector there's not an ad operate you have to be very explicit at what point in the vector you're adding something it's not a container that which you could just kind of keep shoveling things in and it is something appears you have to manage the length of the back here to manage the vector in an explicit manner in order to do that you need to length operator which so it's an absolute value operator you'll see that it's also the length of a and this case so what does this actually explicitly doing is saying okay I want to put Envy at this index so this is the index the way you index into the vector the length of it is before was but but remember it's zero indexed so really that's the fifth place so 03 the length is actually 4 by zero indexing we're going to put the number 5 is your indexing if you're new to all this zero indexing it's just becomes cs101 but but trust me this is it is zero index so this is this is actually 0 1 2 and 3 so by putting in the length of it we end up with or so at offset 4-0 base which is actually in indexing would be space 5 we're going to put the number 5 how you in a you add into a vector can a little bit weird but very very well and conversely if you want to actually print out anything access any entry in the vector CV 0 we should get back it's on the index 0 we should get back to number 1 output is 1 analogous to is this is the explicit definition of a vector we can actually be implicit based on the contents of the vector based on the of the vector Construction please be a little more implicit about it run that in that I would see these are the equivalence is there a coolant there difference in Texaco London execution Constructor and we're adding in a bunch of counts is the same as being expected explicit this is a vector of count in here at the initial initial as you with these with this content that is a vector and brown very straightforward since it is zero indexed you're guaranteed your order and you're guaranteed to allow you can actually duplicate entry so you could have a vector of all one's all twos what have you and it's great for counting up things like that so those are vectors in bra
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:206:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/use-schedule.org:2: sweet and simple to understand schedule and the nuances behind which you could actually use it that's really what all of those but that's the goal is just to kind of give you an idea the schedule for get started here as a means of just routinely riding out something wrong something maybe a cleanup of an event in your ear framework maybe your building out her routinely logout a Proof of Life of your sensor to a log that is dead admit it out otherwise for a very specific reason and nothing nothing to admit you have to think of his you know it says good know some kind of stoplight tide chart with in your sensor for some reason red green yellow something along those lines maybe your tracking some of your health intern of your sister somehow or your determining that is the basis of your health of your network perhaps and you want to build a report that out can have window ain't understand down such that was time-stamped and you have everything you need there it's on your network it's been a good reason have schedule maybe others may have a long as there are an infinite number of reasons you'd want to do something like this to minimize that would be kind of laughable but it is it is definite very powerful very useful and something to consider using and bro for any number of reasons first one is when he's exercise traffic again that's our ever-present go to for good reason we're going to create an event so crater on custom event that takes no argument in Prince a message that's a caveat to and that's something you have to be a little bit aware of yeah that's that's a note schedule events must reschedule themselves the event handler see you first schedule it you are scheduled at more like in bro in it correct and then went in the event when it fires at the very end the last thing if you will the return schedule itself again and if you want to schedule event clearly that's not what you want to do you want to see have a loop and this is how you do that for a little bit odd and that's part of what I want to get across to you is not the out of the oven but just the the new ones nature of the fact it is how you have to do it for better for worse that's the way it's designed that's what we had to do with a counter to track the number of executions and that's just to prove out a few things here started we have enough I believe to run with well we're going to create our own event takes no arguments will just call it event schedule me none too special just a straightforward and we're going to print out a message that is executing schedule me to actually say event be very explicit here is running they were supposed to have a counter so let's go up to the top and we're going to make a global counters global nothing to see here. They were taking it all and then here we're going to just Priyanka minute and the thing to remember we have to schedule this again I believe I asked you to number 3 we want to schedule the event to run every 3 seconds LSU schedule me wanting to be known of it's a little bit different you have to explicitly say event schedule me it knows if your scheduling something it is an event a little bit different than calling your own custom event something to be a little bit aware of its Al Bernard but that's that's the caveat there that's something you just have to get used to him personally and we have two extra schedule the event to run initially otherwise it will not you'll never execute and now for the last part where to print the resulting count of scheduled events at the end of execution which is just a way of saying it bro dumb we're going to say schedule event schedule me ran Sunday Times and that was the global CNT and that should meet all the criteria we we had listed Robinson scheduling event and then within so just to make this even more obvious within our event schedule me we're going to reschedule ourselves but then obviously was in the curly braces within the body of the schedule the event we're going to reschedule it to run every 3 seconds find a better way to do this for scheduling is you should have a global you should have an exported read affable constant that is an interval obviously that you can read to find someplace else and be able to tweak and changes without having to go in and mess with a script directly that's always the better way to do that we're not worried about that here that's not the goal here but keep that in mind if you design around something like this we use it in the future that's the way you're really going to want to do that more control even if you only ever change it on one deployment for One sensor in the history of the usage of that script you've still more than justify doing it that's the proper design choice we're going to use the exercise traffic as noted and down here running running running now obviously that didn't take 3 seconds execute remember this is this is bro just taking a peek a pit firing it through and it's not doing it really improper real-time it's doing it in artificial real-time which means every 3 seconds it's still every 3 seconds according to the counters and which borough is using not wall clock counters not real time counters is going to actually fire that's scheduled event if you look down we should see the very end but it ran 1880 times obviously quite a bit and that proves out that it did execute quite honestly it printed out very well one of the things you can't really look at the number account login understand what you could do is if you're trying to do this really on the network if you really want to provide your schedule is working it is by large within a a little bit of clocks to you obviously Edge round-offs and justice CIBC computationally on a CPU and in with the shared environments not a real time clock you're not guaranteed scheduling within you nanoseconds to microseconds within a certainly in a round off edge of a interval you could print the start time of the end time and then you can put a clock and every time you go through and just look at that and check that that's fine if you want to do that to prove it out yourself it's fine I promise you this scheduled execution is occurring within a very a fairly usable window of time if you need absolute real time clock Precision you possibly going to have issues in general and you probably don't even do this you want to just look at the raw data and use some kind of outside analysis for the real time clock Precision did you need forensic purposes and reality outside of that that's that's fine if it's perfectly fine forensic purposes you're going to get enough accuracy for missing like this to me how you're using it that it's not going to be a problem you're not going to have any issues with that you're going to get within milliseconds a tourist I'm sure of what you would see otherwise and it will correlate with any kind of maybe might have on your network also to keep that also mind you're going to be able to dial in info the information you're after problem and that is the understanding of schedule very straightforward hopefully the nuances are sinking and of the schedule the fact that you schedule the first and then it's the last line of the schedule event unless you don't want to fire it again which that's fine if you just want to set a timer schedule this event to run and 15 minutes from initial startup which is Factory little do you want that to run one so maybe your network goes from about state to a study analysis State you know inside 15 minutes somehow that's perfectly fine and you want to do that's fine that be a perfect you so just running at schedule event once reoccurring scheduled event it has to reschedule its and that is schedule
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:207:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/two-scripts.org:2: this is a little bit of a new one section this is one that comes down to how you want to design your code what are you working on are you trying to build out a new one off framework for any number of reasons and something like this is definitely an example of of that if you want to build your own framework by-and-large you're going to end up using custom events you're going to have things are going to fire like this and things you can register against and this is though you will run across tit any framework you look at is a a grouping of custom events and bra that's from the network code that's from another from another third-party putting out of a framework you want to leverage anything around those knives are going to have custom events so the more comfortable you are with looking at them the better off you'll be in part of the way to do that is actually just to go in and write your own even if they're not the most robust Stellar scary hard things it's still get you think about get you comfortable with reading the code but you can't really understanding what they do and let you understand why so for this one is will use the exercise traffic pcap that's though whole class because it just has so much diverse data in it in a very what about you being a fairly small pcap it still lends itself to being useful across the board two files made up bro and test event at prom so going to that sorry have made it bro bro and will fill that in a bit add event section header the calls the event handler so that I did not give you accident I didn't want to give you that I wanted you to Google I wanted you to look for it I want you to understand and be comfortable with the fact that you're not going to know all of these out of the gate I'm going to put a priority on that just for grins it'll work I'll run it with and without it really does not matter if this but sick of this I'm going to answer it this way from me the right way is if it executes and it will execute for you either way I was testing something when I was when I was so I just added that priority just for grins comfortable something else I wanted to to think about as you go through is the privatization up somebody's handlers how they may affect things and not but I don't want to do it as a mandation because there's enough for you to learn right now without having to think about priority all the things unless it's a specific party laugh but encourage you to look this tried out that way added in or not the right answer this does not include a priority just the way I was thinking about it the way I executed it I put one on there spell beyond new connection Handler we have to think about before I move on to number four is right now if we execute this will not actually see anything from test event. Bro cuz we're not loading it it does not load it by default Triborough not blood type of fault so when we do a load test event and now we loaded now actually get whatever going to put in Testament loaded executed usable Testament we're going to add an export section includes a global event named my test my test event that has a connection argument so we'll go over here to test event name it and we're going to call this where I should go to say this week my test event module export block as I said have a global my test event that had is an event and it takes a connection as its argument we're going to create an event my test event hinder the prince out of the connection as well as it in itself as the my test event we're going to do that within test event what's going to do that organize create that right here so Implement here my test event takes the argument of the connection Siri who's the curly braces connection ID so format my essay test event my test event C equals percent SC Snapple we should connection ID id2 that will take care of that requirement 5 text in Maine. Bro from the new connection event handler we want to call the event handler created and tested abrupt so we want to call this guy and we want to pass the we want to pass in the connection new connection so it's test event in my Testament let's see here we go back here this is where it gets a little bit different you're calling so it's an event my test event test event we're going to pass it the connection otherwise you're just calling them and if you're calling it a venue need to call it like you will call the first you need to call it with a proper arguments I wasn't exposed to end up with an error if you don't eat you can fire an event with no arguments that's fine maybe a great thing to do if your having an an event being used as some kind of car mechanism every time you call it you're increasing a counter somewhere trying to say why you would do that other than using a global function or increasing a global counter but you have the advantage of is an event you can implement it in multiple places and that's kind of beneficial if you just want to have that be part of a framework there's a there's a reason you might want to do something like that but we are number six here we've implemented the inside let's go ahead and see what does ketosis we should end up with a lot of printed out data and we do every new connection we will get caught because we're calling the event handler from new connection new connection the event is defined here they ended test event Bro Army so that's the test event module with my test event event handler and we're passing in a connection and we're bringing it out here so that print is actually coming from obviously here and it is we can prove that the calling of the event we should see nothing printed nothing is printed so that's a clear and easy way to check and make sure what we're assuming to happen happen and it had very much did very much did and that is the answer to this section it is where is a little bit it's a little bit different is you have to call an event say there's an event explicitly you have to Define it as you would a normal event how to create two files really to make this really you know gel together in your head technically body doesn't really have the same impact for learning it's in the same file you still have to call it as an event but you don't really see the power of abusing it this way don't see it as a seed of a framework obviously in this case this is this is hardly a framework this is about as simplistic as you can get but this is the special kind of that seed of a framework how to put together around something in bro something you require internally something you maybe if somebody else talk about you just thought of a great idea when an implement it and share it that would be great and hopefully this gives you some ideas they're on on how to deal with it but that is the answer to create a custom event with two Scripts
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:208:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/switch.org:2: Sweet answer to the lab for riding switch statements with break and fall through what you see is the example template in the lab just basic straight away in the Triboro can you welcome to use an editor and the docker container to execute and solve this lab to whichever you're more comfortable with I'm going to use Triboro because it's it's a little bit easier so go ahead and run this just to see what it was our Baseline here I think that's always a good example errors because of a copy and pasting be aware of that I can't really emphasize that enough be very aware of the copy and pasting errors that can occur in Triboro so 2nd and rerun now we have fallen to the bottom that's something to be aware that's why I always do a test run and try bro if I'm copying and pasting out of anything particularly out of Evernote PDF depending on where you're getting code unless it's straight out of a text editor you know when a control you're going to potentially end up with an illegal characters somewhere or some kind of error like that meaning it just there's a control code that the terminal isn't I stripped in the code editor in Triboro and she'll have that problem it's a little bit easier to copy and paste out of original Adam the io or something along those lines and every copy the kobak Albus chances are those others will strip out that the problem child in there and your lunch is fine extra expansion on the on the lab if you ran into that that's why that's what it is the others concerns that's how you saw that so I figured show the error straight away how to do the first part of the exercise is a switch case in my switch for B with a unique message case be Prince I am solving exercise number one of the lab and then it didn't say we were going to fall through adding just a straight-up switch case adding something to a switch you buy a large should assume I know what sections are not happy Pleasant subject but you should assume you're going to just break you're going to just add that one case statement you're going to deal with whatever it is in that case and you'll go about your business and then we are going to so before we were doing my switch bees we're passing be in B did not have a case that's why it fell to the bottom we should get I am solving your size number one of the lad or whatever your message clearly was number 2 is at a fall through over fall through case to my switch for last to use the same logic as default that reads a little bit rough but what it's saying is call through case instead of a break will fall through the keys in the in this instance is the string last and we're going to fall through the default so case last fall thru so I again see in several other languages that use for you just sent the case will take up like this or its blank the logic and the way the in case of see the way they're similar codes generated is it ends up being effectively and no up and up just fall straight through its optimized out doesn't matter into being a default for clarity of the code you'll put the case in but the optimization of the case statement its there bro is obviously not see it does not generate assembly it's a little bit different of an animal in that regard so that being explicit is what we have to be with the fall through to say hey it is going to the next Pacers not assumptions otherwise that kind of goes back to the roots of bro is static and it's it's a little more rigid and that's actually a good thing in your network monitoring software you want rigidity in that respect you don't want it to be so Dynamic that you don't actually know what it's doing and we'll go ahead and just run that just real quick execute why when I'm using it I asked jumping the gun a little bit here but I'm Number 3 run to call my switch and broiling it with a option case be in a zarf the results we've done that so we got you seen the lab call my switch and Brewing it with the option last and deserve the results excuse that based on the fall through will get falling to the bottom falling to the bottom whatever fiber Add a switch case in my switch for early that causes an immediate return so just for grins was AK and we're just going to say return just causes an immediate return so we're not doing anything else we're returning back out that's it and then for number 6 for adding a switch case in my switch for d with an appropriate message what are these you can actually have your order be whatever you want this is the order I wouldn't I would put them in exercise number 6 answer it says nothing else so we're going to actually break unless it's an explicit return or fall through in a case you want to break it's a pretty safe rule to live by and now will call call my switch and we'll all my switch with d animal rennet and we have a error and that's fine is it at or near semicolon line for it's because that should be a colon hopefully you did not make the same mistake but it's it's always good to see what happens when you make an error in a controlled environment early obviously Prince nothing because we're returning back out it's a it's a check early return early no check check later returned often immediately returning back out we obviously could put that case anywhere get the same results as an as an engineer as a software developer you you want to make things as crystal clear and straightforward and it's obvious as you can for yourself say nothing of anyone else so if you're going to have a case a early and it's just going to kick back out immediately I would make it top of the case statement top of the switch the number one case statement as I did hear someplace else clarity first makes the most sense in my opinion we get the exit number 6 answer for the case D that we had and that's the lab for statements with break and fall through Austin overturn for the early case just to give you an idea that executions still occurs returning back out of that the function anything else and again return as you see the mice which function does not have a return it does not take a return type so return is just a way of shorting out the execution of that function or in a case of an event handler in event handler you're just jumping back out of it and continue and execution otherwise someplace else
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:209:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/set.org:2: Demonstrate sets and how they work in bra and it's manipulate them we're going to start with r a friend bro in it Houston air and we can do the prototyping further quickly already in the presentation so I'm all set local set ports which we have not necessarily but that's okay just this is a very standard example that you probably if you looked at bro at all you Google broad all you've already seen this and that is a sec that is the notation so the Simplicity here simple and I'll go ahead and beautify this just a little bit makes a little bit easier to discuss in trees especially for not fighting your editor forward to finding here is a local set you the difference is we you have to be a little more implicit I think it's you can be if you more explicit about defining a said you can be implicit but it's is the cleaner syntax to go this because you don't have to think about the contents as much in my opinion you can do it otherwise we're going to execute this example you could find what does the things that define a local variable s that is a set of ports add initialize it contents of Four Points should be so on and then there's this for entries you can be this is the explicit way to find one we can actually say set equals set the porch then you begin in the 20 cp23 tcpa TCP and 443 TCP this is a second way to do it This Is War The Constructor if you will wear this will Val set last one that we've created equal to a set of ports that is implicitly determined based on the contents of that set Broncos are ports of sudden counts face when they say take out the TCP the reason I'm using something a little bit new this is a very standard thing you'll see please set this account second be any fundamental typing bro extended type if you're creating your own person like that II set of colors as shown in the am in example he noticed to be red blue pink and purple fine no other two notations I could I took out the TCP and that's the only difference between S&S one the fundamental types of this is now a set of counts for sports we could easily do the same thing here just to make sure we're comparing and contrasting the same we go except we have to set this equal to count it is a set of counts supports I won't work otherwise run that the Run fine no errors set up accounts when which were in being explicit about what it is and we are also explicitly initializing it immediately upon creation S1 is a set being struck being put together by a Constructor the set Constructor that contains the counts 20123 80 and 443 these are actually syntactically different functionally the same so that you will have to decide which way you prefer another way we can do this just so you're completely from ways you can do things in bro scripts will give her the second example so we're going to go ahead and create a set that is the contains counts canes integers but we're not going initialise it we're not going to put anything in it bro knows what it is it's Define we use the ad operator with the set as an argument bracket and then we can add what we want in there and now we run obviously this lot more code to write out it's a little it's little it's not as obvious in my opinion The Witcher nationalizing to I if you are initializing a sad and you always going to have a set start out with values that you care about BB explicit about return this wising it to instead of equal to 21 2384 3 just go ahead and get on with it I would only use the ad notation is if you're collecting things up as you're executing in an event handler are in a function what time you really want to add to a set in that capacity do you end up with a lot of extra Konya to maintain again to find Those ads where they are where you put them in your code and it just it doesn't make sense again unless you're collecting things up as you're executing I would not use this the syntax here for an initialization if you want initialise use use initialized initialized initialized when he created it's quicker it's faster to cleaner and it's definitely easier to reference later than having to potentially go dig up plus you know if you if you had a couple lines you might get sloppy and one extra curly brakes you might actually drink some other code we can take out future operator air engineering error it's always I even if you're not you're talking a minute here minute there a minute here in the dare you could put portrait some other use because of this difference you might see this till you might see you some other bro script otherwise created this way and that's fine I just for me and my sister bro and I think money other people's uses your bro script the less you as a reference but you have to read it's always better we all have a million things going on and less is always more in that case condition of this we will go ahead and delete you want to delete something out of your set do that is there's an operator I delete operator takes the set and then what you want to remove delegates to the the add operator and will execute and it's gone that's simple those are sets and bro and how to manipulate it by using how to define them you seen the various in taxes in which you can Define them and it's it's up to you I've given you some hints on what I would consider to be the preferred way to do things play for me but this is kind of how it goes over all you'll see it defined either way and could you looked at and hopefully that makes sense and gives you an idea of the best way moving forward in the way should design your scripts

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:211:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/http-sum.org:2: this'll be the answer the lab for implementing a sunsets framework bro script determines the total of methods using HP flows in a sample pcap get vs. post setter from the outside I am going to say unequivocally that summary statistics in bro are absolutely brutally non-trivial the answer to this which comes from heart hot a little bit of struggles with it and otherwise difficulties with General now with that said the weather radar Pro Shop stats before I get it Ashley stop in this lab if I have it already. This enough is Define those sample bits and tidbits and information and scripts that you can start from the hardest thing you can do in in programming a general is start with a blank canvas the hardest thing you could ever do and thankfully the need to do that is almost zero is at 0 + with some stats starting there is very much an uphill battle and one that I don't advise anyone really to do unless you want to you want to go fine by me but don't unless you absolutely really really really are determined to otherwise so if you started with it you're in good company I would be remiss to say that I haven't struggled with some stats having used it quite a bit it's a it's a it's a steep learning curve it's extremely powerful extremely useful but the learning curve is extremely steep honestly is a subject with him bro script itself that we could probably spend going through a lot of examples of going through a lot of detail especially with diving implementation no optimization points here and there and everywhere that that are possible we could probably spend a solid week just looking at the summary statistics framework and exercising and teasing out examples and going through things and I don't think I'm best exaggeration of of the reality of the power of this framework and the complexity unfortunately one big S the other at times and it's is very true that it is it is very powerful which means it is also rather difficult to learn at times a lot of information crammed into a what is really relatively elegantly small framework For Better or Worse that's what you have but mobileserve hopefully is something moving forward that you can lean on and the some stats and otherwise it will at least give you a look at some stats again that's that's fine at least I give you an appreciation of what is possible if you do ever want to revisit it hand it off to somebody else to deal with either or obviously what you see here is his number one in them the exercises just copy and paste that the framework that existed as the template into Triborough or otherwise it in other than you can use soccer or otherwise to execute them in command line there's a lot of ellipses in here there's a lot of details not filled in for obvious reasons the point mystic force you to dive through documentation to read it I get an idea of the robustness of it obviously I am just for many things are somewhat random just to make him or takes a little less screen real estate for the demonstrations obviously too which is never bad but not absolutely necessary lots of years of looking at code and brain personally reads things efficiently in certain ways not awesome I wish I were the second part pick the appropriate calculation to use to some stats reducer if you look the document you think looking if we want to find the total number methods for an HP flow of those messages go get vs. post versus what will probably going to wind up using his top k in top number of thanks so we just infect leak leave off the top and we're worried about nothing else so that gives us a starting point producer sometimes producer we can start filling in some the stream will be dot method you can name it otherwise but this is nice and straightforward no ambiguity we know exactly what we're looking at and yes be very careful these are Unicode ellipsis if you don't remember I will have a problem I just doesn't FYI you want reply set of some stats okay for the top size of 50 it's a bit as we get through it and you may tell her that also obviously if you got the answer you may have already if you haven't feel free to go in and tweak this again use this as a template uses as an example of something you know does one thing can you massage it into doing another for your purposes somewhere else and that's them fundamental approach you can use here so we got the receipt template portions here so we can go to create a named some stats of hu underscored method of 12 hours producers of the set of all that is what is to find here and a buck was also another with every 12 hours it'll fire this event doing this and try bro fire it artificially we talk obviously based on the the the replay that pcap and not an actual wall clock time fortunately and that's something else to keep in mind as you go through some stats Scripps Deepak if you're going to fire it make sure you have some bro some Peak apps that you can use against it so you don't have to wait to see if your is your approaches succeed or fail engendered update up some something available other than live network data in order to test your hypothesis otherwise it's a slow agonizing process it's already not trivial don't exacerbate the problem by not having test date available is really the bottom line I think that's if not been stated elegantly it's been hammered home throughout the course try to do things statically before you ever do the dynamically always be capped before live Network traffic always there are instances where you absolutely cannot that's appreciated where you can it's really comes down to being that simple so for the rest here so we have the Prototype filled in the results are going to the results of the stream hdb. Method stream so that's what we're going to actually run through that's what we're collecting that's what we're worried about this is this is not a lab this is not an easy thing to do this is something if you Google it and you find an answer for us on the clothes great and you got the lab done great frankly you answer the lab if it works the way it's supposed to you did it it doesn't look exactly like Road Great Sharon example I'd love to see it might be many times more efficient and that's great I would really like to see that and I'm sure share with everyone else Lovelace let's all get a little bit better at this it sucks same battles of protecting our Network so let's see if we can do it together as best we can create a local Vector of observations this is again where there's not a better way to put it then it's you have to do too few times you have to fall on your face if you times and you have to see these scripts after a while to understand what you're looking at the work comes down to have some examples and that's the goal here if nothing else you as a palpable working example that you built up what we're going through and doing is we're going to fight results of issue method have been collected up over time this is mapreduce for fillers mapreduce that's what some stats is and you run obviously method over top of that pull at your data sifted sort it and deal with it accordingly we're going to do is we are going to create a vector of these observations again allows us to have duplicates versus asset which is D dupes everything advantageous when you're looking at statistics in this capacity and I'm going to grab the top of the top cake get tops over and grab the top bits out of the results which we were already said was top K that's the set we're building up and we're at the top 10 we're going to pull those out of the 50 that were collecting up we're not going to really we're going to run through this this vegetable putting together we're going to print them Cruiser not the heavy lifting is under the hood here it runs through the collected data that we're collecting up here in the reducer it's putting it into a vector that week and then do a for Loop over and manipulate in this case we're just going to print them we're not trying to do anything too crazy here suicide print format method equals percent ass and then will print out the actual thought so as of Eye of string again I know it's a string because that's what the observations are there is so many there's only certain observations you can pull out and it's a string after I have to look at the the records you have to dig through them there's a lot of details here that we kind of Breeze through a bit and the overs overview section of the summary statistics and you have to get in the meat of it to really start understand where those work the goal here is to let you know to make some Headway to read technician income and to come up with a solution that may work or may not but you'll learn from this example scrub you to take what I'm showing you here take it back and then reread the problem and then executed that's the beauty of a lab like this it's not it it's not meant to be anyone down it's meant to actually show you something that is hard and let you even use it later for your edification it is not true this is not trivial to say the first time I went through Neal building and stop and think about this until he wasn't doing it and what have you with regard to summary statistics. I did right would be laughably long wrong go with it it's okay I don't don't like I said you're anybody who didn't get this magically is and great company as far as I'm concerned clothes that out should be all we want going to print a little extra here pretty that closes that out now what are the things I wanted you to observe what is a couple things first the creation of this the some stat honestly brutally simple wow that's that's crazy that's actually it is it's deceptively simple and as you implemented is brutally difficult is the Elegance again of this framework hopefully I'm doing a good job of you want the power these it is really cool as so many things you can do with it but I also don't want you two to be overwhelmed by the frustration of it because of the power behind it and a lot of things coming together it is not trivial another big thing observe and learn is okay we've created this wonderful having a very simple method here we don't have any observations we have no means of getting data in there so let's just let's just for grins execute this Cy Firex buddy exercise traffic because of the Simplicity of it course there's a bug sutech Saturn your ass bumps that right there , I do recommend going through an embassy firing these things a times just to make sure that nothing is broken course we hit we don't think we're trying to print but this method as there are no observations some stats are Kings of observations sure where I should try to pull out here recruiting the Specter of summary some stats observations that weird in populating using this method and one thing note is it executed fine which is great and his clean that means everything else here is good with Ronnie issues their lease of code execution we don't know if implemented it right but at least nothing's going to crash and that's in and of itself a wonderful thing but reservations otherwise we'll never know it works or not type the stats part of some stats I can't tell you how many times don't worry again and good company would you add an observation you're adding it to the stream so you have to make sure that this stream this string here is the stream it must match your reducer stream if that's what you're after mind you these have to all be correlated and in this case the epoch results when it fires were to finding this event the results Must ALL match so these almost light up if that's what you're looking at if you're collecting up a bunch of different statistics creating a bunch of these different method name of these different things going through maybe you're creating it tons of Statistics just realize you have to map those altogether to be cognizant of that be aware I honestly will have to say I do not recommend putting a ton of some stats single text file into a single file just for some save yourself the headache of trying to keep track of things break it down have a you know a nice director with an underscore underscore load underscore underscore. Profile and load those up individually to be a hero in and jam everything into a single file you're only going to run yourself ragged debugging because you're going to debug I promise so do you have is the string which is the method that were after and that is from a sphere Cuesta Methodist here and that correlates with the string here so there are some correlations there we know how zirbel's do we have the right observables I don't know let's go to run the script and see we may exploded may work flawlessly it worked so number of get methods we have any exercise traffic Peak Cavern 252 then proposed in 97 and never of head methods are 10 fairly reasonable given the will run against HP cool is one get and if we actually look at the HDPE flow we see a single get so that's that's a little more than coincidence problem you can do the same thing or SMTP could do the same thing over any protocol if you want to dig out any kind of Statistics along these lines again this is a deceptively simple script for being your 22 lines or so complex and this is the answer to the problem very straightforward anyone else sold it otherwise it would be great to see it great to hear about it Siri questions and concerns is it going to say that I've gone through some research who's framework is complex as you can see the Elegance of oven is seen with the what am I sleeping over finite scripture verse small script here and what it is able to do go through and collect at those statistics and print them for you and show you what they are now the whole printing obviously just to run it one more time again pointless unless you doing this static analysis if you are not doing static analysis you need to admit those statistics in a log they could be consumed down range why you end up just putting stuff to standard out and that is up in the standard out log and by and large that is going to be fairly unhelpful for you lizard lizard Mama see others other sections side things to keep aware of a bit of review from from those other sections but something today again to be aware of I think some stats is a brilliant thing to use against a bunch of pcaps she can collect up the statistics take him back using otherwise over longer-term flows Reebok because this day has been collected in memory depending on what you're collecting you're consuming memory you're going to see memory anyway depending on what you're collecting depends on the amount of the actual volume of memory that you are using be careful there why is that is the answer to the sunsets framework
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:212:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/http-large-flow.org:2: Notice around a large HEB flow event ground up script I gave us I think so how will see if you got through this weather that's true or not the whole notion of what this is trying to do is ground-up of you need to look for a CP I gave him so what you do look for in H-E-B needs to be able to check to make sure those just within those records are you made it up running into problems you need to understand what connection State remove dolls as an event so now I guess to a new connection so now I guess you know if you want to say new connection in case they remove analogous to Growing it in bro dumb very straightforward that's all they are and then be able to find all the necessary things for a notice to be able to have it be usable and otherwise fire appropriate well further Ado let's going to find out if the event the singular of it and here we are worried about but one second before we do that will go ahead and Define the muscle first will call this module how to cheat in your welcome to do this and if you didn't do this that's absolutely fine and I'm honestly going to explicitly just load the base Frameworks notice and mostly out of habit just because that's how I've been doing that works long that's what I'll do does using AC be if you're staying that used to be mods existing module via the module you gained all the access to the variables in that module we don't necessarily have to do that I'm just going to do it that way so when the notice fires and this is something to keep note up and then notice fires whatever type you extend it'll be HTTP colon colon blah if that's the notice type that you if you want to do it based on your corporation name based on your group name based on something like that for the module and then it kind of extend from there that's not a bad idea actually it's an excellent idea if you were to do it that way I'd be a great standardization method otherwise if you and do it onesie twosie for specific purposes that's also fine the bottom line here is there's no correct answer the correct answers what works for you anybody tells you tell you otherwise because they now I did say to go ahead and add that event so I'll follow my own directions connection State remove C connection we're going to fill in here in a bit thank you for that second is Define an Xbox way to find the module I went into that first S4 block and then will close the export block again I cannot really stayed in fact Lee enough why you want to go and do that even if you're like a family thing and it's not a bad idea going to do it Define value to use as the trigger for a large the next bit here I give you the record fields that you need to look for the response body length in the request body length if you want head and looked up in the documentation for the HP record the affair record with an HEB actually that's a great idea to go and do in general there is an absolutely enormous amount of information in that record in that info record that is there that's the nature hdb in the right bro handles it but it's it's really more the way it should be worse don't be familiar with it but don't lose too much sleep over memorizing any of it just know where to find it know how to understand it and hopefully by now you understand the fundamental types and effectively what's going on there to be able to sit to sort through what you're worried about what really matters and be able to use it effectively you're at that point not this will open your eyes a little bit more so we'll do I declare the word definable value here in a Riddell football value constant yeah that'll be a constant it will go and say was called bad length it was set equal to just say 10,000 what that $10,000 will soon to be bites because that's the one area that bro does not have a specific being into the main specific language it doesn't have an ocean of write a gigabyte terabyte and so on and so forth and that's okay greatest shortcomings we're all doing just fine clearly so we'll set it to 10,000 that seems like a fairly reasonable initial triggered it kind of weed through what's going on here and your actual environment you'll probably have a defined value that will cause you some kind of concerned anyway usually it's a few megabytes something along those something there is really what you're worried about where you're going to lose out eventually in his using at the beach GT people low and slow type of tax you really don't see those vht be too often if at all that's where you just have to kind of thing through it and then the next vote for here the item for defied all the required values for a notice in an export Blackwell as I've already said we have to do the real for the notice time the word anchor add into that I will just give it something original like large it's beef if you notice is we've gone through my my propensity to capitalize change capitalization standby sing for me no right or wrong whether you make this all caps all lowercase if you camelcase him whatever you're comfortable with whatever your standardization is is the right answer I have a tendency to make things kind of section capitalization appropriate the best I can you want to do is is perfectly long as you and your organization when you're developing things like this have reached consensus and everybody can be as best as humanly possible read and understand everybody else's code and the artifacts that are generated can be consumed down range that's all that matters keep that in mind always as you go through anything like this so 4 section 4 that's everything we need that's a notice that that's the part of the really the Simplicity of you have to carry with a notice you just have to extend that tights Smyrna do that and everything else just falls out it's a function call think of it as nothing more complex than that filling in a record in immediate fashion when they're calling their function that's it is it it still looks different it still looks different but that's all it is and now we're to use the user definable Value Plus the notice within the connection State remove event to generate notices when required and then check and we're going to check that he should be record exists is populated within the connection record other words this is where are you now with this far into the course there's some expectation of kind of trial-and-error here some Google searching obviously I can't prevent that and I wouldn't prevent that that's not reality when which we live in now that you you have access to go you have stackoverflow you have GitHub use them but you always have to use them with the caveat that you might be downloading maybe accessing maybe using somebody else's bad code and if you so choose to do that that's fine you mind Learning Farm or doing that from scratch good thing I'll be at but not a bad thing it's something I can can't I would stop you from doing if I could so the the hit in V bomb item there is we want to check the DHCP record exists within the connection that is populated that it is something the reason being is connection State remove is fired a lot we have no means of saying hey we are we are looking for H-E-B connections being removed only when we call connection is removed it is a event handler going in the event handler Q with all the other connection State removes it did not special other than what it is populated with so we have to explicitly within the body of connection State remove check to see if we are looking what we're looking for are we looking for this to be a we're going to be late should be able to deal with FTP SMTP none of the above now this is where my hole popping on look early in check early return early check off and return off and you know just as soon as you come in the singular thing that will void the rest of that event handler needing to fire is the absolute first thing you need to check for if it's not their return in this case this is an effective return so if it's not hcp we're going to kick back out just because we're going to I'm going to do this 7 minutes body this with that that check Suburban Estates and we're going to say return and that way if it's not ACV record is not been sold return immediately the rest doesn't matter otherwise we are going to look to see if do you use the example nose from before I I think that's a pretty good structure if you're looking at both the origination ocean the destination I was to see if there's an odd flow of events there's nothing wrong with that approach and I think it's actually a very a good template for moving forward so we can use the set really generate this sent again on the flying here to my own rule of closing things out before I start the next block so we're going to Loop to repeat this house or Loop through those two those two values the origination of the responses we're going to say if see CP we're going to check to make sure it exists first body length so if it doesn't exist for me lean all avoiding out of here that's it it's it it's not there the rest does not matter this is a neat Nuance at bro used to very quickly links request body length is greater than greater than equal to the bad length large depending on which concerned with if you want to trip right at the bad length or just over so you don't want it you know plus one or a right at there's no right or wrong it's whatever you're trying to achieve here I'm going to say greater than or equal to 10,000 there's no right or wrong for this approach it's just depends on your internal criteria if you want to implement something like this in the reality and in your ear actually really work I want to say large HP flow and we'll see message was for Matt let's see here what I say percent a switch will say the hosts were in front of the house and we're going to say whether or not it's local or remote 2% s that will be the client of the server this is the natural way in which you actually build up notices overtime as you just kind of you find out you find a rhythm with them and this is how you parse them down range had a request body length 5% d and now what is fill in the details host site is local Adder on that host true cool and if it's false it's remote and we'll say is host equal to C First Nation host the client else client else is a server we will add in the crust body length as a set and that will take care of what the notice will contain it will say connection is that and that takes care of looking at the request body iForce feeling so Brazen which I think is we can actually copy and paste this and we're going to look at the response body length set a request it's for check your response this is part of the reason I wanted to do this if you don't change both you're going to end up crashing bro at some point did not necessarily nhb no sir for this reason but it another area be very careful of how you approach things I'm just going to fire and run it against traffic pcap there's a there's a ton of ACP traffic in there I think there's one over 1100 connections so willed will trip and fall over one or two that I'm sure and more than one or two more than one or two so the local to the server have a response body of 16762 that proves out the script is working not worried about directionality here so if you're looking at internal versus external your want to change up your script the note if you want to have it be specific to your organization you maybe your company name that's a great idea to do something along those lines it just it just depends on your operating environment again how you're fighting is no decision whether to being used downrange and how they're being used on Range you need to make decisions I I can I can sit here and make suggestions all day have to agree internally in your stand requirements in what works best for you and go from there the right or wrong is whether it works and if it works you're right and he was a rather large one so we can just for just for grins there's no right or wrong again to the stress holding we can set it to 250 thousand and I'm guessing the number of actual notices will get here will be cut a lot while does he still get one we saw the one looks like it too 13 and then see it's due next is the analog of that I should I stand corrected it is not actually I do apologize yes it is yes it is so that's what you expect to get at 7 both into connection and that's that's fine can do is if you're only worried about client-side you can set it turn on IP space and you can filter it a little bit more and it kind of go from there so it origination host instead of the responses which we could actually just take out that side of things just take out the responses here it's really a singular set so obviously the codes a little bit silly that for Loop Riley actually ends up nothing just the one side of the connection as you would expect private Network IP address space and it's going out to a destination so that would definitely local decline is wrong it really should be server so you have to go in and massaging sweet things a little bit but that is the full script and how you would ride it
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:213:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/hook.org:3: Hooks in bra what is a another flavor function their summer events and they can also have multiple bodies have their different into regards and just before we get into those hooks are also something that are missing to use in Miss Miss use depending so be very careful understand these differences very careful and they do execute immediately when it involves so these are not Advance they absolutely fire melee Taylor terminate further handlers get executed so if you have hook test one hook Test 1 Test 1 and they're all linked by a priority then depending on where you break oh so you break in hooked S1 II with a priority of 20 the first month 1033 break in that middle one that means the last one will not fire where that at the end of the body or return statement is reached the next hook Handler will be executed so if you return or execution ends and then hook the next hook Goes Forth a hook Handler body that terminates with a break statement No remaining hook hangers will execute you can kind of think of this is the way bro executes is it and by the prioritize them it actually concatenate some together so hook one no one priority 30 is the top priority one priority 20 is the middle hook priority hook one priority 10 is the bottom defect Lee Sandwiches in the gather the way Pro deals with it is it kind of nullifies that return and it goes eyes and executes the only exception is if there's a break bro handles that is where of that break is in any of those handlers than that's what does not execute that's the biggest thing yours is the break is what will disallow further hook execution of that type anything else like what a return does or the end of a call and a hook body is happening if only thing you remember from this is the fact that a break means no more execution of hooks of that type remember that and everything else is actually just gravy the way you use can you use hooks hooks are useful to provide customisation points for modules as they allowed you to announce her decision to cite specific code so this is effectively The Next Step Above and Beyond using a reed death actually execute code to make decisions you can actually execute code to be able to say do you want to continue on you then you can fire a break or not return value of a hook is an implicit bull you don't have to Define it it's just assumed to be that went so the value of T remaining that all handlers for the hook or executed f means that only some of the handlers may have executed do the one hitter body exiting as a result of a break statement if around a hook all executed in that if will then expand if your chicken for True you'll actually go into the body of that if and if you're not it will go around it or if you're checking for not true so you checking for Falls then the then that if body will execute just depends on what you're looking for depends on whether that return is even necessary a lot of times you'll firehook and it'll be for kind of a side effect reasons and you won't care otherwise maybe those hooks are they going to do a read f or something odd calculation out of rehab but doing to do a calculation that then you are going to use otherwise somehow so be aware of that so usage they got to lose it already there good as an extraction Point obstruction point for execution decisions they going to miss an extended redef this is a readout that allows you to execute code so you can yes you do some kind of computation versus singular on off switch way and they make a lot more sense they are very powerful but when misused they actually can be a very powerful way to cause frustration and confusion instead of actually allow you to get work done more quickly and they may be used to alter the personality of the sensor execution so as I said it is an expansion on the readout approach to the small versus large sensor configuration and approaching is you can do can you do calculations instead of just singular on-off switches that is very very very cool it also lets you as I said kind of the personality we can load up and it'll actually do a hook in from that hook and look and say okay this hook at your the code is xq in the bus trips loading up that's what this Hook is for a smaller sensor and that set certain values does certain things maybe you're setting the same file name so you can actually have the same load statements and everything but the contents of that are different based on that personality and it's going to be a larger sensor is going to set values differently larger values adjust things do some kind of calculation and call it a function otherwise black without being a singular on-off switch it doesn't based on as they say kind of a personality script that you have this Global that loads this Hook is global that load in your local bro the same then loads these personality scripts or singular scripts you can salmon be the same name and then the contents of them can change you have to change how you load it you don't have to go in and just really how you deploy this is the strength here is it's deployment you're copying something different than actually going in editing a file or using puppet or something along those lines to change something really handy when you're doing meal you can kind of Upstream to a makefile approach to this what makes a tiny sensor rolls up the right things that you care about Valley that smaller sensor you know make make large sensor will do the inverse of that roll up the big configuration files necessary and them big hook files capable of doing what you need to do an electric sensor that way it makes a little more sense and you understand the power of this you know so understand the confusion if you're not very careful and you really need to test things out assumptions and hooks are what a really bite you and I implore you to if you remember nothing of what I said in here other than the fact that I hook it can be an extended read if that allows computational code execution the fact that a break will break the chain of hooks being executed of the same type remember those two things and everything else is just bonus any good reference to look up everything else those with those of the two points especially the second one about the break statement they will save you time and a lot of hopefully relieve a lot of potential frustration the decoration Hook is very simple simple decoration hook and then the argument an argument is possibly empty and it writes a comma separated values they are declaring for Global usage so you can it's very it looks very similar to how you would declare a global events or Global function Global name you're giving it the differences it's a hook inside of a function or event and then the arguments where is an implicit Boolean return type so as your executor of all hooks executor returns true that means all hooks executed if it returns false that means one of them what could be one or more of the hooks did not execute you don't know bro does not provided that information back I would say in most circumstances that you will never need to know that because you can tell by the side effects of those hooks anyway what did it did not get executed don't worry about that too much just know the the implicit true true or false is a Boolean true is all hooks executed and false means not all of them executed executed they 2
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:214:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/hook.org:5: speed demonstration how to use Hooks and bro and give you an idea of what they look like they're usages it's one of those things that your best it's best you test them it's best you looking existing examples what I'm trying to do here is to show you some of the Oddities to him at the further Hammer home the break-in return break being the big one you have priority especially effect especially in light of usage of break too crazy here very straightforward this example was taken straight from org end up something in prayer I would have been done something very very familiar it's not identical but it said we went ahead and just borrow that was there was phantom pain and show you more of it I'll go ahead and go over it then I'll run it it's an event it's only been handling here is borrowing it very typical going to execute the hook my hook pass string High based on priority but look we priority of Tim 8 sing a hook or a event without a priority is a soon-to-be priority 0 so effectively right in the middle then one would -5 so that should be the one that will execute last in light of what we have on turtledove 10025 you passing high that should pass all the way through unless you're otherwise redefining it I hook should be the first priority hook should be Naruto funny s equals by remember the interesting thing about hooks can kind of take out the curly brace in the next definition of the hook and kind of weldy's altogether where it gets fuzzy is you have a brakes or brake over turn out of there next function in Theory read this right call it it will be executed with as equals by the string should say break out of my hook handling should print by the end there's a break and if there wasn't that break we need to figure out if this and execute it shouldn't based on everything we read in the toilet right so was that let's go ahead and run the other thing to keep track of call hooks execute implicit return of true the hooks above here would have executed so the bullion Rhett would be set I'm going to test that and then print all handlers ran if not that will obviously not be executed let's go to run it and see what the results are says priority 10 Mi hook Handler High we passed it high and that's as it expected now we passed in by or we didn't pass it we actually set the value s by which again these get concatenated it's a little bit strange but normally you think well I'd have to call that function again but it's implicit bro we'll just go ahead and effectively take a look at those bodies and kind of weld them together internal how to execute them break out of my hook handling by is what executes and the brakes we never get to this not going to happen is correct we'd never execute well we can obviously fix that that out and what do you think we get two things to change should get the not going to happen with bye handlers ran because the my hand look my hook returns true nothing that I have not talked about is you have to be explicit in saying you're calling a hooks are the same instead of calling a function you can just call the function and bro to fire hook you to say hook and then the name of the hook in an any possible arguments do you have to be very explicit and that's that comes to the fact that not exist so let's show them this is this is the reason why we're going to come in all these out we're going to run it Pro doesn't give an error because it knows that that hook Handler my hook does not exist that's a big thing to be aware of you don't have to actually implement the hook Handler you cannot implement the hook Handler and by not implementing it is also actually a value in bro that means that it did not execute and that's something to be aware of the value of return true in all handlers ran which in this case is wrong they didn't exist so that the hook handlers didn't fire but the default value of the bullying is true so the prince that so be aware of that that's a major caveat that if you're doing any kind of value didn't exist so unless you just you're designing around that possibility you're going to have some interesting things happen that you could have to make sure things happen you have to fire up the script debugger and and kind of set a breakpoint there and figure out what in the world's going on and that's a that's a good reason to do it we go up here and modify this another break return here the return is supposed to act the same as the end of code execution as we've talked so we should schedule them all effectively this this return the way bro welds things together as I keep describing them these all became effectively one statement that return becomes a no up and effectively just goes away return and it's it's a special case function or you can see the Special K event handler that it bro knows it because it's hook that return really doesn't mean anything different than a the end of execution of that hook Handler it again and no opposite effect they just takes it out of coat that execution you don't worry about it here to make this just a little more interesting set s equal to final statement and I'm here definitely definitely right and we should get high by and final statement highest priority highest price 10 and we said bye out of my hook handling and then here after it says it does not break we set s again equal to final statement and said we should say that makes more sense heino in front of statement in all hook handlers ran so that gives you an idea of hooks you can wrap through the Bro scripts that ship with bro to see some of the hooks capabilities in there there are file extraction Frameworks that exist out there if you look on GitHub you'll see a couple file extraction Frameworks in which it loads up is a kind of describe a different personalities you can give your sensor in this case the subset of capability of a bro and that's the power structural framework you're on Ellen say I'm a very late in Microsoft network and your your modern things and you want to only extract office artifacts so you're going to work look specifically for mine types that correspond to office documents in word excel PowerPoint and you just want to extract those nothing else on that never you you're worried about maybe they said it's late and Sound by the SMB Network and that's all you're worried about play find that's one of those examples of the personality types prescription frame archi build out using his hook capability Spanaway weather capable of as opposed to just doing the on off switch of Redux that's not to take anything clearly away from readouts powerful you could even run wrap your hook loading with a readout for some reason though as we've done straighten will show one more time we coming out all the hook handlers here gluten-free run this example do you want are out because those is a function doesn't exist but is not a function it it goes had an executes and instead of just returns and says hey you know everything returned true everything ran fine because of the Fall below values a true and we're good oh that's that's the game I want to hammer that home in a little bit to keep that in mind that if you're not instantiating hook Handler if you're testing for it there is that that's it really it should be a kind of a Tri-State type capability where are in umm of some kind where it returns back no handlers Ram all Handler successfully ran or none ran the way roll currently works it is a caveat that could get you a little bit
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:215:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/funcation.org:2: function declarations and bro we have obviously seen these for a while going to go through in one off examples and in demos now we're getting the formalities everything ocean decorations they follow names same namespace rules as variables no local namespace Anonymous functions which Orlando's in Python Landers and many other languages so no local namespace no Anonymous functions just keep that keep that in mind you're going to want to write code to that because it's not it's not going to work in the bra and it has a product for this is a prototype of formally exporting as a global of function so this is an export block as soon as an extra bottle with a global this is the way it looks now pays very special attention this is Austin Texas's I'm going to expand on this low before I describe it just because I want you to really pay special attention here this Syntax for exporting the function prototype is different than the Declaration of the function that actually filling out the function y because mainly because it's it's simplified for going through why's it was a design Choice it is the languages that stands be aware of it it is not as obvious as you would see in C or C plus plus normal saline go or any other language it's it's a little more but this is the most work with so glad this is an export what time you really would use this prototype format like this is if you are exporting it otherwise be using the function from within your module you just declare the function and get on with using it only time this matters is if you're exporting it that's the other caveat you never explored a function for executioner usage otherwise will matter but so we declare Global we name it then we gave it to arguments there is actually a opening princi here and this is a, separated list with a prince he hear the return is optional you only put a return if you need it but it must end with a semicolon or you'll end up with errors it is like this party again it simplifies at why is it simplify because this syntax is the same as declaring a variable that's why what makes it different what makes it special is instead of type you have to formally declare it to be a can hear that's the differentiator and that's what makes this a little bit different but it was its Simplicity of the analyzer of the language line up why do you care about that don't buy a large but at least gives you an understanding of why things look somewhere in helps you associate why a functional traded in remember the syntax versus having to look it up every time look at her house so I promise I do but cemented in your mind why it looks like it does it just it cannot infer that a function is a function versus anything else the difference between explicit and then it goes I said returns are optional already discussed that the returns are optional function of the problem without a prototype may still be accessible when it's definition is loaded I have to export it it will just go in that Global namespaces we've already talked about if you don't exported it will be there to be used otherwise the definition example so we've we've shown you before what's the if we were to if you exporting us but this is the actual function prototype it looks very similar to golang quite honestly the semicolon at the end of the bottle by sure if you used to moving between go and golang another language is this it in bro script the semicolon can you switch back the other you will make that are be aware of it I say that with again a smile on my face after doing that more than I care to remember be aware since the function sample that takes a single argument is string s and returns a Bull a bully Clara local rat the return equal to true principal function and return true turn right which is true very simple very academic crazy going on here just more of a shell of how things work that is in a nutshell function declarations and bro they are very straightforward my large you will use them decent bit be a little bit the caveat here is be a little bit careful with row over and over using functions I know that's going to sound weird I'm a huge proponent of using you know if you going to ride it more than once use a function but be careful and bro for an optimization if you over use cilia function that's within functions nephew was in the functions you start to actually lose some performance and that's because of the way bro internally has to build up the various tax and references and affectionately wind-up large stacks of cplusplus objects in order to execute those various function blocks and return things back around and deal with them careful Again by a large I am a big fan of functions I use them a lot in every other language your bro I have to kind of stop take a step back and think about a little bit is it worth the possible hit of performance it depends on robust emotion is Shelly saying if you're going to really experience performance hit if it is doing a lot of heavy lifting or you're doing lots of nested function calls you're going to want to unwind those nested function calls because that's tax basis going to get a little bit crazy with that the way bro does things and turn them are doing that for pcap analysis that's again a different story then if you're doing live network data you always see want to save as many cycles you can for Life network data to squeeze out every bit of performance you can out of a sensor on a peek at it's not that you wanted your throwing away Cycles but by and large it's going to run faster you're going to have things return back quicker you're not going to have your network data is live Network date is effectively an infinite tap obviously keycaps are finite even large pcap are finite unless you're keeping massive tables in memory or things like that dear exhaust memory doing that if he cap is not going to be ever worse than life Network traffic it's also more predictable you can figure out your bounds on a pcap live Network traffic unless you have something Upstream shaping your data being sent down you don't know you absolutely cannot know but that's the caveat be careful of massively nested functions shallower the better wear appropriate even at the cost of having a copy and paste in duplicate sand code of his very finite fundamental code that's fine you it's annoying but do it it's well worth it for you function declarations in bro these will look like Goliath experience they will not look like too much else in Python exactly why is our standard best friend forever Define a function C function Prince and now we're not going to take it so we're going to close for immediately I like to format it where I put the curly brace open curly brace to Claire the statement in the function standard your standard maybe to put it on the same line you want to do but standard that's my only suggestion wasn't I always like doing any clear function or an event is go ahead and close the function and go through everything have it may be absolutely perfect you need to teach me how you got for the first time but you don't want to do that and send me forget to close the function and still that's that kind of skates so I always close it tonight's Habit to get into and within our event ruin it we're going to just call Prince hey we have to always put in parentheses there's not a there's not a notation that if it doesn't take arguments you can just say semicolon in the statement I don't know what to do now you have to actually say well but it's a function so you actually have to give it prizzi's open and close we should get nothing nothing sitting here so that's that's an example of a very simple function the function of Prince and it's going to take an argument a count so classic parameter and the subtypes so it's variable your wine didn't Claire for the perimeter colinde in the tight we're going to take a string s string and we'll go ahead and fill it in so for this let's just pray nothing crazy Sprint we are going to want to call it number in the first argument is type count 34 2nd minimize number of arguments you don't want 25 arguments spanning three lines if you're doing that probably not going to do that and then ever-popular so we would assume you'll get a will get one two three four, the commas implicit the print will not will actually add to come between them I will get the string test nothing crazy there for now function take any arguments there is a function that takes arguments one or one or more arguments the functions that actually will return something so the format for that is function stuff so let's take what's a swan strain strain ever going to return a string that looks very deep how you declare that is very similar to how you declare a parameter for the function the function definition so open the function close the function and now it's still in the function we're going to actually say return stuff so there's no return operator we're going to see return there is string concatenation S1 Plus or add a space and so what we should see a space LS1 add with space - - - 3 - is space and then S2 semi colon and is returning back a string that's the type is returned there's not a print so unless we do something with the data coming back on the floor by the bro he doesn't care about it The Voice just to demonstrate that was safe return stuff that's not going to say first argument so we know explicit we know it takes two arguments because this past one which is a type string and S2 which is a type of string the first argument, second argument Sandra separator letsrun we just we did the nice little string concatenation in the function what we can do with that a local try stuff and will print temp what are the first argument read ashes now we declare a local variable here how to do that why don't we just print that return same visual execution little more efficient those are function definitions in bro those are the three forms you commented on the answer is probably if there is so, this function maybe your standards for coding apply to bro don't overthink this if it is very clean crisp code it's very obvious the rules of the day always applies don't over comment that's her function definition for pro effectively the three forms I'll show you just one more just so it is absolutely obvious and this one is going to take one string no returned I use we know that because one ARG comma S1 here I

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:216:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/debug-logs.org:2: other logs of interest in bro sounds a bit nebulous because there's if you're loading up everything out there there's virtually infinite number of logs that you could generate especially with the now the knowledge of filtering these are the standard ones were looking to look at the ones that already exist the ones you can enable usually be a very simple policy script being loaded they have a lot of purpose of around them for debugging for profiling for statistics analysis and ingestion capture laws to figure out if lost my are you might feel like any of them you when kind of analysis of the fact that you are losing data maybe you're running bro control and looking at some things but this will give you a how to enable and disable these things to be able to look at them and understanding debug your in the field and also in development clearland show me the profile of a prophet log this turns on profiling upper resource consumption profiling statistics and you simply at load policy Miss profiling. Bro and you'll have the profile the prophet log generated this will work and try bro this works otherwise now what I caveat a bit the use cases troubleshooting a sensor to turn resource balance boundary issues that you're running out of resources but enabling this profiling log if you're really near the edge of your resource usage and you're getting lucky and you have sized your sensor just right and you didn't add in the extra you know 20% 30% Spike possibility have your networks never doing that your calculations were brilliant put you over the edge though is then trying to profile it because they is going to keep more data accumulating in memory send it out from there so it's a good and bad thing is a double-edged sword you need to know that it'll help balance it out maybe you turned on your Center crashes because you're right at the edge of your memory usage on that sensor. And you're not running swap for performance reasons om killer kicks in and Nails bro takes it out at least you should hopefully have a couple profile log entries to be able to look at and then realize enable this script that is a huge lesson to learn and Broward General you are often times very much okay until you enable the latest script and you wind it back one your gunt this is where I come in to say that I should have said repeatedly throughout the course use a source code repository of some kind Version Control your bro Scripts I'll save you much time and even worse you should not use this on a production sensor at all times you can enable it from time to time if you're really trying to track things advantages you'll get a lot of data disadvantages production sensor and then you have to stop at eventually disable this log and then started again so that's a lot of bouncing of your sensor Michelle I recommend that SL as you may have within your organization externally that may not even be feasible keep that in mind and plan accordingly in the end and use it accordingly should be part of a bassline exercise before a sensor deployment so Baseline understanding of Hardware episode VM otherwise of your network and what it looks like a bro and it feels like coming out of logs it should be a good Baseline exercise and then turn it off and production every once in a while maybe you keep a sensor that has a t of your production data that you can enable and disable to profile in real time that day to maybe get an exact if you have infinite resources and time that's brilliant way to Bill to do things it's it the resources as the cumbersome almost more than time depending on your network the capture Lost Locke alright this is the diff definition this script log evidence regarding the degree to which the packet capture process efforts from measurement loss from measure effective are measurable lost lost Scooby-Doo to overload on the host or Nick performing the package Hampshire or it could even be beyond the host if your caption from a switch with the span Port it's very possible this is something I really want to make emphasis of that's a switch to self could be overloaded and dropping packets Asus computer in terms of the number of Gap events acts for sequence number that's above Gap lessons to be learned here or go above and beyond the capture loss log when bro is struggling it's not always bro it's not always your sensor Hardware it could have occurred well Upstream as alluded to hear span ports tendency to overload because of the Asic in the way the mesh works in the switches they are copying things a CPU is actually running hot because it's not going actually through the Asic is going through the CPU and out that specific port is burning up lots of clocks apples copying that data letting the Asics take care of topping it's appropriate ports across the bus of a switch that's why that occurs that will occur special on a saturated networking when you were especially see it is on a network much like the profiling log but in the network side of things when you are just at the edge of your available resources you enable a span port especially during peak times of network usage going to blow over the top of your span port and you're going to start it's going to switch is going to go into save itself mode and for the span Port it's going to just dropped packets because the CPUs busy otherwise to be aware that if you don't see data there's a reason and a lot of times it is upstream and if you have a means of sampling on that Network outside of your sensor I recommend doing so just to see if there's any kind of capsule lost look your switch does your switch give any kind of statistics on loss of transfer dropped packets or anything like that if so the Smoking Gun is Upstream off your sensor is still possibly and coming up on you to fix it or pull up roses solution at least but at least you have support those claims and that is the capture lost block much like the previous profiling log you just simply load the policy script and then it'll be in able to be written down to capture underscore lost along and you can begin parsing it from there it should not be used all the time my high-bandwidth networks it comes down that resource usage to you until you care how many packets you lose or do you care that somebody enabling something you may lose more packets for me and I think most folks that use bro is sick worrying about losing more packets it's a network if it is a saturated enough Network enough data flowing bro is going to going to suffer a few losses you're going to lose some data and that's never good and no one ever wants to hear that I load saying it but that's the reality you're going to lose some data plan accordingly work accordingly and you'll be fine it's it's not the end of the world there always be some more data if something is truly malicious on your network and that you're so concerned if they're on your network you're going to see them again they're going to be there for a while and honestly for span Port is Stephanie's white-hot from earring data and that's knew that might be in itself be worth investigating perhaps not malicious but something on your networks changed and be aware of that resource statistics the stats. Log improved greatly into 5 and will be ensuring and proved more moving forward I bet this logs memory packing and log statistics elac statistics the amount of time it takes to actually write out a log mixing austrians a log and lag but you simply loaded it's a policy scripted you just load like the capture loss and the profiling it may be used on high-bandwidth networks I have personal experience with this log it is it will not bug you down too much if all is kind of a similar idea to some stats framework where it'll login epic of data and then flush it out it will work just fine on a headband with network and honestly it is a great way to get the data off it is superior to if you're used if you're any running bro in a used to using the pro control statistics and pulling down those stats log is definitely less overhead and more efficient and more effective I'm doing it otherwise so I recommend migrating to that approach and and I been with networks all the ones I've been I use it on occasion on daily and that's many of them you might run into very special edge cases where it doesn't work well it only doesn't work well because of resources and that may not because the box is in the provision Too Well Done Network may just be that severe Alabama in that saturated but this is definitely one of the non-standard enable logs I recommend enabling and profiling your sensor and understanding how much data it is using how much resources are being consumed by it and then using the data Downstream to use as a health check otherwise it's a very helpful log and then you're against us to statistics can serve as a baseline for understanding resources requirements overtime use that as your Baseline use that as your ongoing generation maybe you're going to put it in a croissant or something like that and log those statistics overtime and in take a good hard look at how your Center works and and go from there maybe you shouldn't get additional behavior in your network as a side effect so if you suddenly start seeing spikes and the memory the packet in the lag statistics that is in itself in indicator anything bad this early indicator of something going on this different is changed otherwise been there since Baseline take that for what it is and use it use that as a means of writing some notices writing smoke alarms for house maybe you're going to intercept the stats login filter those and Firearm there brought you to look at Upstream if you have multiple sensors deployed you can use it as a means of correlating date of there to keep that in mind and maybe they may be very specific attacks a very specific resource usage and one location than another or you might find out that you have a distributed denial-of-service across your infrastructure and various disjoint locations which by and large would be a fairly sophisticated service for most companies big or small so that's something to definitely be concerned with and look at and with that that is additional logs of Interest they are every useful and ever expanding and ever being optimized I would assume that in the future there will be a few more like this who was bro but at this point they throw these three years together inappropriately give you very interesting insights of your sensorstat salt log is especially useful and in my experience and especially if you get it off your sensor in an expeditious fashion either streaming it via one of them alternate writers or logstash off or otherwise that then you can take that day to distill it and look at it super interesting is when you have disjoint sensors across an organization or disparate locations that you can then look at and analyze Peaks and valleys of data over time in your organization can you have statistical information there if you start seeing the bell curve up daily bandwidth how much of those can you make a Venn diagram of the the bell curves of your daily statistics she's me up Network usage using the stats log across your Enterprise very interesting research thing and something that might actually yield some very interesting results

User ID equals 501 keep in mind we're being explicit where the user ID column on user on the score groups equals 501 so once we run that then we get a nice-looking name here for the group ID on left hand side and the corresponding name to the group so that is a join for the fur goal for being able to find the groups that my user user ID 501 is a part of how to do a demo and look as an example of another join but this time using listening ports so this time I want to show the difference between the inner join and left join where to start out with a simple query that selects the process ID and the name from the processes table as you can see there are quite a few processes right what we want to do is we want to know if any of these processes have any are our listing for any incoming connections if they have a listening port on the system do that by joining it with Imports table okay to say select or unique listing for stop ports and process friendly processing inner join listening ports the PID using that share column which is the SSID let's go ahead and run this will see that there are indeed some some processes that have listening ports the zero is relevant in this case there's some hidden information that sometimes we can select that it would make more sense the point is that we definitely are processes that have a match in the other table in the listening ports table when we change this to a left join let's see what happens I just changed it to left join and we'll see that there are now there are all the results from the process to table right cuz if you look back at the query were saying show me all of the results all the rows in the process of table no matter if they don't have a corresponding a match in the right table and listening ports table there isn't a match put no one there PVC a bunch of nose right here so these are don't have any matching or corresponding data in the and listening ports table okay again remember that the inner join is the default join so if you just say join it's going to be an inner join okay let's take a look at one final example parts of were back at hoes Corey I promise and I'm listening look at the logged-in users table okay we say slick star from logged-in users so this table shows us all of the users I have an active session on the system you can see with the type column that there are some inactive sessions the user and then you see dead the user name the TTY time and then PID now it would be pretty interesting if we could join the process table with this table using the PID column to see what processes of these login sessions are associated with so I've two questions for you blocking users and the process of table using the PID what kind of join should we should we use should it be an inner join or less chewing cable should be on the left side if we all live all we want to do is see this information with the process name and the process path what should we do okay I'm going to pause this or let's try that again let's have you pause it and take a minute and think through which kind of joining should be and which tables should be on the left okay we're back now while you pause it I went and grab some coffee so I we should be ready to go let's take a look at what I join would look like I'm using a left join so walking through this query we say select a logged-in users. Types of the type column the user column the TTY and the PID columns from the logged-in users table and then the process name we're just going to the process name from the process of table from processes so where were saying at least for the square that the process is going to be on the left side left join logged-in users on the process of that PID and logging uses have PID what happens if so we get we get the information we're looking for so we have the concessions associated with the the process things but will scan other information not really not really what we want we just want these that's because we're using that left join people that query backup remember so we have the process of table on the left or saying left joins were saying join all of the records from the processes table with logged in users whether or not there is a match you know whether or not there's corresponding data and then just put Knowles for the rest and so that's what we see there so let's try this now instead of a okay inner join and it's looking much better inner join now it's only going to show us the record matching values between two columns the PID columns except you'll notice that we don't see the inactive session we only the active user so let's do one more query this time we're going to do summer going to do a left join swappa tables we're going to put princesses on the rights princesses on the rights alright that's makes sense so processes okay and what we've done here in this is our final query is that we change it to a left join and we put the logged-in users on the left so we're saying select all the records from logged-in users join it with the processes and if there's no corresponding record with the processes table just go ahead and print the Knoll which is what you see here and we could throw path on there and I would see a lot more information right is the differences again between the election and the inner join left table right table and just another example so that ends are on joining I completely understand if you still have some questions about joins I definitely can be very confusing I'm we have a lab or two for you to go through a please also ask questions if you run into issues
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:749:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/osquery/1.1-filtering.org:2: parcel next couple lessons it'll show you how we're going to be using filtering and joining okay so the big picture is that we went to list all the local groups for specific user in this case Meyers RJ Brower too much sense at first don't worry I'll explain in more in-depth in this listen and the next lesson first so we have to start out with selecting the username userid shell from users table because we need to find what my user ID is and you can see that at the very bottom ERJ Prowler my user ID is 501 so next we want to go ahead and select the user ID the group ID from the user group table where the user ID is my ID 501 this is great right it's exactly what we're after all the groups for my user it's not very readable right now we would rather have a group name rather than that look at the group table and see what we have group name from groups right so there's all of the group IDs on the left and the group names on the right so if we can actually join if we can join a couple tables here than we can get all of the group IDs and the group names for my group what this last query is we're going to join the group group table which we just saw and the user group stable and that gives us a nicely list of the group names of all the groups that I am a part of this is the big picture and the going to be breaking out over this lesson this one we talked about filtering as well as joining let's start out with filtering when dealing with large tables we need to figure out how to construct the queries in a way that allows us to return a more manageable results this is where filtering comes into play operators allow us to refine the data that were clearing for so that we get that men's will results you can see there are quite a few operators here we have the equal to not equal less than less than or equal greater than greater than or equal and then between and like in detail and look at how we can use them practically scary to get that more manageable results and we're clearing larger hose query tables where the evil operator it actually seen the evil Operator just a minute ago when we were doing the demo we did a select user ID group ID from the user group stable user ID equals 5 semicolon in where Clause is the different clause say where the user ID which is my user id equals 501 this grouping right looking at the opposite of the equal to is not equal to we can use this in a query like this we say these select username shell from the users table where the shell does not equal a string user been false Sims 4 Mac OS where go ahead and filter out all of the users that have a bin false shell which could interesting insight into what users actually have a illegitimate shell on the system this case just a few for as he has 5 results are including my I'm in that is the not equal to operator now we have the less than and greater than sets we can use this in a query like so select username userid from the users table where the user ID is greater than 500 on a Mac OS system typically system accounts are less than 500 and so again this would be interesting query that might give us some insight into what user accounts are non-system accounts are on the system running this gives us the following results in the username of Jay Brower and nobody with the user ID so that is a greater than all the rest the less than or equal greater than greater than the between operator operator allows us to see between a particular range inclusive looking at a query we say select username userid user ID is between 100 and 500 inclusive part means that we are including any users that have user ID of 100 or 500 I seen before ordered by the user ID columnist what that means is that allows us to sort the results is there ID column ascending we go ahead and run the square eat get the username on the left username on the right and it's sorted by user ID ascending finally the like operator this is one of my favorites as you'll find yourself using it quite a bit in OS query operator allows us to do pattern searching with wildcard the two wild cards that are available are the percent sign and the underscore % is zero one or multiple characters and the underscore just as an H1 Single Character first example here select username userid from the users table where the username like % at admin % finishes query what we're saying is username that includes chapman and anything before or anything after it's so what that gives us is username with some interesting looking usernames what's going on with that K Edmund unsquare change password it's definitely check into okay now our second example is going to get a little more complicated here we're going to say select username userid from users where the username and said of life we're saying not like and then we have some gobbledygook here okay let's break this down so on Mac OS system there are many system accounts that are pre pended with the underscore character find any counselor in the system underscore unfortunately for us the underscore is a wildcard character so we need to find a way to escape that that's what the Escape Clause does at the very end there it says that any character after the backslash treat that character as literal okay so when you have that not like we say not like Escape character underscore so we're now now we're saying wild card so that's our one car % this is saying select and users where the username does not have an underscore at the very beginning all right what it gets us all the users on the system that does not start with an underscore hopefully these two example give you an idea of how powerful and flexible the like filter is so that was a quick look at filtering operators with in SQL the equal than not equal the less than and greater than sets between and like remember that when you're trying to query tables you definitely will be in some cases where there's just too much data to quickly and easily look through it using filtering gives us the ability to refine and results operators that you can use these are just some of the more common ones that you'll run into next lesson will pick up on looking at joining
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:750:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/osquery/1.0-basic.org:2: Construct basic queries to get data out of those tables we need to touch on something that has tripped up quite a few newcomers to the OS queer community and or Square D what was Prairie IAC interactive shell of os query table comes out and you're trying to figure out what queries you want to run across your entire infrastructure I was correct I would be what you would use that for system copy to local system drop into the interactive shell and you can spend some time explaining the system figuring out what's going on with it what Square D on the other hand is he dating component of owls query you use it for scheduling queers across your infrastructure to track state changes over time you would be running I was pretty as a demon I'm across tens or hundreds of your systems it would connect back to the management server that we're going to be talking about in another module and that management server will be what's going to be sending it the configuration for what queers the schedule where to send the logs and things like that is that there is no connection or shared resources between OS query I and O Square D free I to a query the old Square D database connection now interesting know if they are actually the same binary if you rename most demon mode in two separate Moe's interactive shell and the demon mode use Osprey I to interact with the Daemon in anyway there's no connection between the two again it's one of those things that a trip up newcomers talk about tables tables are an integral part of a database and a query is no exception find information about the current tables for osquery is on the website I was crazy. IO / schema you'll see something like this this is a snippet of the system underscore info table description underneath that is system information for identification upper right-hand corner that this different platforms at this table is relevant for this case Mac OS Linux windows and the vsts next up we have the columns names the column type and a description of the column no at the current time there are 200 plus tables available for osquery and there are more being added on a regular basis just to take some time go to the website and see what's available usually filter by platform as well as always crave version and so you can really look in detail at the political platform that you're interested in and what you might be able to query for that particular platform send text perspective as queer use a sequel light and so most of the functionality you find in SQL I you'll be able to use within OS query look at a very basic query getting two more dance craze in next couple but we should always start with the basics so we have these select keyword to select whose name uuid columns the system underscore info table semi colon is important that makes it clear that your query is complete or at the very end right so once we hit enter on that here is a result we can't host name JB - Mac and the unique ID for the system this lesson with a demo of the oskari I shell as well play some tables and some basic okay so here I am at my terminal I already have those crazy installed so I'm going to run sudo always Creek by to drop into the interactive shell oarfish is with an elevated command prompt or Powershell session in order to access those cables on those query that require that level of permissions will see that we get a new shell here if you recall I most Curry is based on super light and so we have SQL Lite shell commands stuff with you. Help that shows us all the up he's one of the most important ones right off the bat is exit she'll be simply just by doing. Exit or quit and you're out next up will get a little more little more difficult from their next up is we want to see what tables are available to query on our system as well as for our version of osquery soap running three to six tables that's going to list all the tables that are available for us to query with his version as well as his platform that were on can see when I scroll up there is quite a few tables at 4 one in particular we want to do some sort of crap and so we can actually do. Tables and then the key word I'm looking for something related to users I can do that tables username tables to look at I can go. Schema and that will show me the scheme of the particular columns this allows me easily if I do is Select what's select the user ID username Michelle from the users Caesar's table and there are all of our users okay now as we've discussed previously there are some tables that irrelevant only for particular platforms and so let's see if we can find one for Mac iMac does have a feature called keeper ahead and search. Tables for anything with the word gate in it you see that there are two tables now we can look at schema or we could just go ahead and say select homes from gate now fortunately there is tab completion so we can select gate keeper and we have our table name they're already laid out for us you know what I forgot I forgot to say from select star drum words with lots of Dana but unfortunately, it's not very readable in this format right just too much too much line rapping there so let's change the output mode through. Mode and change that to line rerun that query and we can see that there's still some wrapping but it's a bit more easier to read in this output mode things that back by going to. Mode machines at to line rerun that right just too much too much line wrapping their I forgot to say from Flagstar table price of Pasadena but unfortunately, it's not very readable and this format right just too much too much line rapping there so let's change the output mode through. Mode and change that to line rerun that query and we can see that there's still some rapping but it's a bit more easier to read in this output mode change that back by going to. Mode and pretty rerun that query in your back do the output mode we were in man I love to dude help put to Json so I can more easily imported into some other tools I use let's go ahead and try mode Json and unfortunately line list and pretty if we drop out of the shell we can run over screen on interactively and output as Json how to do that we're going to do sudo OS for you are query query in a single quotes and then dash dash json as is and then - - chiasson what that does okay and tomorrow in two more end up carrying in the next couple lessons
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:751:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/syslog.org:2: That will take a quick look at the fast logging format does the human-readable text-based format they'll be familiar to those that if you snort the past by default what is limited to logging alerts only a quick look here by default if named fast out log other stuff I only has two entries in it start with the timestamp followed by the signature ID signature message for event message application protocol some port and destination address is this logo put is very similar to fast Al-Aqsa syslog instead of a file is important to note that uses the system logging service rather than sending directly to remote syslog server sale by default show where it's turned on that's open that circotic Refrigeration file here that's under the outputs section with a key name of syslog and search for it with Dash slug will see it's enabled or disabled by default change it to yes has a few other areas just love parameters you can change if necessary that will take a look at the unified to alert output unified to as an alert only binary output primarily used for integrating with tools designed to work with snorts unified to Output before we can use the unified to out but we have to enable in the configuration file find it by searching for unified 2 and then just said no to yes there are a few other options are quite similar to start unified to Output that you can change if needed but for now we'll stick with the defaults LOL run suricata against the test my IDs pcap file I'll take a moment to run and we should say Unified to alert file right here view it with a storage unit you to spew food tool stairways the Advent record followed by a packet record another event record and final packet record the TLs log has a legacy format for logging TLS certificate metadata to a log file as TLS certificate metadata is also love to Eve let's hope what has been disabled by default well now and able to sell put in and take a look at its format the first we will have to turn on in the configuration file can find a buyer looking for TLS - log disabled so I'll turn it on leave the other settings at their default for now we will now run suricata over a pcap containing a TLS certificate should see a TLS. Log file to see right here will take a quick look at its format simplifile we have the time stamp address and Port destination address and port and the details of the certificate itself such as the subject in the common name in this case this pcap contained a request to the Google homepage the TLs store is used to log actual TLS certificates to files naked Scene It will not one file containing a certificate in another file containing information about the certificate in plain text Works in combination with a TLS. required to trigger the actual logging of a certificate as a TLS store is a disabled by default we will first find it by looking for TLS Dash store the first will turn it on now that does log2 files / certificate might want to sit the certificate login directory uncommon the default location just starts which would be the directory certs under / bar / logs Plattsburgh Canada and as I said you do need a rule Apple rule the very simple rule that will match on any TLS packet and here is the TLs. Store keyword that will trigger the logging to a file now that's runs her cat I using this rule file over a pcap file known to contain a certificate 2 - s parameter will just use a single profile alright log directory see the certs directory and two files she is the dot metafile which contains metadata about the certificate very similar to the information you would see logged in the TLs - log or is the TLs event in the E fog now the other file. Pam is content format look similar to certificates you would use in a web server

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:753:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/osin.gpl.org:6: pretty pretty good let me take a look at the virtual machine that we will use for the suricata online training exercises and Labs were sitting here at the login prompt as the OSF user we can log in with the password of suricata and all lower case now we are at the desktop here will do is go ahead and poke around her home directory and see what we have here I said the Terminator show one of the things I like about this as we can split the show sing me need so you can right-click and split horizontally split vertically I will probably use that in just a bit here home directory couple folders that we care about the exercises exercises we have distinctive. Rules file all the rules that we write we have these Siri. Sh file and that is the first by what they look at this is a very simple script to kind of need in writing signatures and testing them over and over and over again check to see if the directory then make a new directory an old friend suricata not checking checksums little read in the PCAT that's given to it as the first argument and it'll log out all of its files to / 10/13 blessing here was print out the best one distinctive. Rules files is just simply World writer rolls keep keep in mind that file in exercises HP caps here Venice is where we'll start our exercises
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/NSM-GTD/Pattern.org:754:/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/osin.gpl.org:9: hello everyone my name is Jason I like to welcome you to the rule fundamentals and IDs deployment module in this module we will be talking about what goes into a certain kind of rope guess what it is what it does and why we care so much about the we will get into the fundamentals of writing rules starting from the most basic building blocks and work our way from understanding to writings options we can include norville's to better detectable we are trying to find about the same time hopefully preventing false positives will getting to the metadata of a rule so that when you or someone else in your team looks back on the roll a year do understand your intentions when you wrote it getting to some light pcre don't click out of the training yet I promise it'll be okay troubleshooting strategies as reading and testing rules can sometimes be a painstaking process deployment sections about some ideas nodes and will end with the lab so let's get going what is a rule attic and generate metadata about protocols such as HTP and DNS on its own construct the engine to look for specific markers and network traffic what about if they are most commonly we think of malicious Network traffic when we are writing rules but this is not always the case anything that can give me additional what's going on with my network call my network alerts to help me tell the story of an incident that I will of course write a rule for that hot new Trojan command-and-control traffic that is generated from the most vicious in but I also want to write a rule to look for the Dynamic DNS domains that are I also would write rules on any interesting or abnormal HP post traffic that can indicate similar activity this way when the authors of the Mauer change the checking pattern on the Trojan my signature may miss on that part but I will have lots of other alerts around it to help tell the story radio rules of ultimate art form the freedom to get creative and how you want to write your rule follow that will make your rolls efficient and clean rules are written in a simple language that instructs the sensor to login alert to the configure interroll you will specify multiple contents that should all be present in what is essentially a big and statement before this will be somewhat of a familiar concept if he's written store trolls before the con the syntax will be very similar Source Four rules can come from anywhere Dauphin first found on blogs and tweets someone find something delicious and share it with the world Network component to it and we can record them our talking in a packet capture it is important to remember that as he write rules and apply them on sensors each rule takes away a little bit of available memory and Flash or CPU guidelines to follow will help to ensure that you are writing rules in an efficient manner that will keep your sensor from getting too bogged down with poorly written here's the basic conceptual structure of suricata IDs rule from a very high level expand on each of these items in the next few slides the first part of the rule is the header we want the real tabs along with what protocol suricata should expect this world to be found it who's a pair of eye peas Imports and has an arrow indicating directionality the second portion of the rule highlighted in blue indicates the real message and contents 2% of the analyst review in the logs contents are the portions of the traffic we that we have Dean critical to Detective to learn on the last part of the rule in reddish-orange there is the rule metadata also keep track of various aspects of the role near updating troubleshooting or deploying rules each of the sections understand what each one is starting off with the rule action Direction tells a story about an engine what you want to do with this rule should the contents of it match the options are as follows generating alert and log matching packets let the traffic through log will just log the traffic and not generating alert password nor the packet and allow it through if an IPS mode drop will drop the packet can also send TCP reset packets to the originator of the connection the action of reject both IDs and IPS notes that's the first thing we put in our rule typically roll start off as alert in an IPS deployment you may end up switching your Al and if you actively want to deny traffic and IPS or IDs mode you may end up using reject moving on to the protocol suricata has the ability to detect specific protocols declared by the rule writer tcp udp icmp IP SMB DNS among others use the protocol you need in your rule if it's available you're writing a rule on some HP traffic use the HTTP protocol little protocol decoder for the crafty or writing a rule for you UDP or IP that is the second element in a row header no we have to declare some hosting Port values the way you have to declare the directionality of the traffic Williamsport variables that are configurable by the Third Kind of dog this big file contains defaults but double check them to make sure that they are appropriate for your environment the two most common variables and X HomeNet often were first intro networks or whatever you are protecting with the sensor external that is usually classified as anything that is not home yet there are other variables here such as HTP servers SMTP servers or you can even make your own variables for using your rules if you want to specify a single IP or range of ips here in between the two IP port pairs is an arrow directionality example shows traffic from the monitor Network second example shows traffic from the external network to the monitor Network you can also write bi-directional rules but we don't recommend it unless you really need to as this causes double the traffic to be inspected by the roll slowing down your sensor what was the host we have the port Port always follows the host value in the header declare the party was traffic for this world will be evaluated use any to indicate that this traffic could occur on any port but sometimes we want to be specific our first example here will alert on TCP traffic from remonter Network on any port to the escrow Network report 9003 like the host variables Portsmouth variables as well such as HTTP ports SMTP ports FTP ports cetera these are configurable in the yellow file and you can make your own variables if you need to Port City indicated by placing a bang in front of the port number Port values can be expressed in other various ways I need the number to describe a single port such as their first example here of Port 80 we can express multiple ports by wrapping brackets around a comma-separated group of ports we can express our range of ports by wrapping brackets around a colon separated pair of numbers we can get fancy music combination of ports example says we are looking for traffic sourcing former monitor network with any port above 1024 for the Extranet on Port 8800 between 6667 and 6680 6679 so you can get pretty creative let's do a few group exercises take a look at the highlighted packets in this Wireshark image how to fill in the blanks here sure to use variables with default values when you see the dollar sign the concept we're not diving super deep into the network information so you may have different answers or not enough information is given to make a sound informed adult decision nothing here is going into production just yet feel free to pause the video if you want to try and figure it out so we know that we are ready and alert role need to enter in the protocol value tells us that this is HDPE so that's pretty straightforward we would use HTTP protocol The Source address rfc1918 to the privately assigned addresses that are defined as HomeNet in the default suricata configuration will be the variable home net as for the port since we have no idea what port the machine would choose to talk on so we put any as the value here we can see that we are making a get request to the server so the right facing Arrow nation is an external IP so we will use that very we talked about earlier start on that Nation chorus 80 which is commonly used to be flexible is protocol detection to ensure that we are looking at 8 so we put any here it should look like this hopefully that makes sense let's do another example the video and figure it out we are again looking at the packet highlighted in blue again we're reading alert roll and we need first decide what protocol we are using click anything I recognize and Wireshark BP is a protocol see that the handshakes took place in the first three packets in the capture calls identified by Wireshark is TCP again we're looking at rfc1918 address as our source so we make use of our home net variable again we can't be sure the source part so we use any Nation looks like an external address roulette there in the port seems to be a very high uncommon port typical usage for the port the for this example we would just use any information here here so we could use as our glider that's example see if you can fill in the blanks right away we can see that we are looking at DNS traffic here Wireshark tells us in the critical columns or protocol will be DNS our source appears to be internal net on any port to any host on any port why you would choose any here for the destination host some networks have internal DNS resolvers I want to roll out that traffic if we specified external net false negative alerts on a roll without us knowing we choose any of the destination for it and let suricata handle determining what is and isn't enough traffic they'll do it for the rule header you should understand how that works the next portion of the rule the world message

Jason or recommended up with these days fast out log which is a text-based format that'll be familiar to snort users and stats log which is the human-readable statistics what's going on inside cercana the Evo put Hustler referred to as Json logging is a flagship feature acercado short for JavaScript

Json files on the command line described as a tool like said talking crap but specifically for Json most Linux distributions and should be easily installable with app get yum or Brew on the back we will now take a look at a neat. Json file with the help with haq tool for this demonstration of using an eve. Json that was populated with events from a few different Peak apps in order to show a variety of event types so as we can see here I haven't Eve. Json file it is pretty large 23 megabytes we will take a quick look at it with less first so you can see here on the first line we have the object just a timestamp field flow ID so on an event type of http hi II record has another Revenge Type of HTTP and then here we have a file in for record typical you're going to have many non alert records such as HDPE DNS typically have another being triggered information so this is where that JQ tool comes it comes in handy so if you want to filter out just alert events we can cat the event. Json file to Jake you want to see how we're going to select for the event type equals alert that's also has the benefit of colorizing you'll put for you let's just look at the last line here we have a I reckon that starts with a timestamp the flow ID before I D helps you correlate what event against other events that happened on the same flow the pcap count which is the packet number within the pcap file that triggered the alert it should correlate with the same packet number when looking at the capture file in Wireshark we got our event type which is the alert Source IP Source Port destination IP protocol having a subject alert with us Pacific's of the other details I'm action to Loudon at IDs motor everything's going IPS mode that my baby dropped generator ID which is always 1/4 cercado signature revision the signature description or message the category or the severity mjq is also able to pretty print this easier on the eyes just remove the mitasie honestly just look at the last one it's all broken out at least you to look at I'll also take a quick look at a TLS event so just change the event type 2 Cialis and here we can see you record from a connection to Google will not take a quick look at an SSH event so just sent type SSH we

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:2:Hey y'all and welcome to the next lecture and investigation Theory the analyst mindset and here we're going to talk about open source intelligence or researching unknown threats Fletcher (filter) filter
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:5: we're going to dig into open source Intel and how it can be used to investigate evidence and learn more about specific threats there's a lot of material out there on 
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:7:open-source Intel and you can't go too many conferences without seeing another talk on it and this lecture I may not talk about any sources that are particular new to you 
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:9:but will help to provide some interesting perspective on how you can build osint Research into your investigation process describe what types of evidence and questions will most often lead to a need for osint research
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:12: I'll also reference the knowledge base Wiki we talked about in the last election
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:13: we've been working to build Tom and how you can use that to store and reference the ocean information you're collecting in the various osint sources
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:14: you will be using open source intelligence generally refers to any openly available information that you can obtain further investigation probably some much more formalized definitions
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:17: now  osint can be almost anything that meets that criteria it could be a list of domains that are resolved to a specific IP address a list of malware hash is associated with Google search any of those pieces of information
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:19: if you found them publicly available on some online Source then that's benefits pregnancy investigation that qualifies is open source intelligence of course
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:23:but I guess letter of the definition open source means it's openly available to two most folks osint manifest as a third-party website in most of the time
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:25: so a few of these that you may be familiar with are on the screen here now virustotal is a and all outside the snow by Google that allows you to either submit the md5 hashes to see previous results 
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:26:or submit binary files and have them scanned by number of antivirus engines to see if they detect them and what they call them who was the site that Aggregates DNS resolution information
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:31: and that's certainly not be relevant to your investigation domain and IP registration information so for instance the Whois domain registration information of how is domain names or the ownership information tied to IP ranges
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:32: so those are just a few different examples and will certainly discuss a few more as we go through here the most cases you'll generally enter into open source intelligence research
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:34: because you've encountered a specific type of evidence in the context of an investigation usually that'll be something like an external IP address and domain name a file hash or a string obviously 
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:37: you might encounter the evidence because it was part of an alert and in these scenarios the evidence is often apparently malicious just by virtue of its existence in that alert so for
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:39: example municate with a domain that is known to be evil he probably like the hope the alert would tell you why the domain is evil but in practice that often isn't the case it's unfortunate that's true but a lot of times you're going to be pulling into texting sources that don't lie provide that content
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:43:you're probably not going to be incredibly concerned about the alert since the reason it's on a bad list is because of the shared host environment however in another example what at the Domain was known to be owned by an attacker and was used 2.2 systems hosting malicious content in this case
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:45: going to be very concerned and will look for evidence of malware being downloaded by virtue of that relationship. they're not only that are Al some type of Suspicion now that was inside the contacts to an alert but outside the context of alert where the evidence would be here the malicious
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:48:if you find a service name you don't recognize the file responsible for that service that's on the physical system becomes interesting in the context of your investigation and you're going to want to find out everything 
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:49:you can about it illegitimate system file then you can probably move on and look elsewhere but associated with positive antivirus engine detections
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:52:in this case that texturing has become suspicious based on the context you found it with sufficient arouse you can start a command-and-control string or something found in the streams output a malware is often the case that you may find a random string in a in a conversation like this and Google
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:53: it and find your way to a threat reporter some malware listing that also provides that steering wheel rattle on context whether evidence is inherently suspicious or found a suspicious context
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:57:and that's only the question you're always asking when you're clearing open source intelligence no matter what source or what type of those senior clearing that's the Common Thread
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:59: so now course several other questions will be derived from what you find that's a great thing but that's the common question I saw some of those I hope we are already digging into some of those and working on your own playlist what I want to do next is give you some strategies that will help you focus your efforts while doing osint research and seeking out answers to questions
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:61: that derive from other ocean research what's dig in a little bit on Focus questions related specific evidence top and what I want to do is actually give you an acronym that I developed a long time ago when I noticed a lot of analysts in a security operations center
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:64:so I would get reports that reference all these different size finding a whole lot of extra time doing duplicate at work looking at the ascent research sites that really perform the same job and therefore they really need to be looking both of them in a lot of cases so in this case that acronym is very simple

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:69: Material out there about building security Labs but the vast majority of it is centered on building labs for penetration testing there's a lot to be learn there but the considerations for a network security monitoring lab are quite a bit different as offenders we have to worry about simulating and actual investigation environment capturing packet data and having the ability to run and monitor malicious software these tasks can be a bit daunting so it's easy to get scared away in this video on this lecture all simplify the process by providing a systematic approach to building your lab step-by-step once you're done you'll use your lab to test new signatures you've written do triage malware samples and and to see what logs are generated when certain behaviors occur for example what does an RDP logon look like to a Windows server at the packet level and at the Windows login level these are important questions to Defender use my lab nearly every and the same can be said for most of the forensic analyst oftentimes having access to a good lab makes a difference between a good analyst and a mediocre one if all or part of your job revolves around investigating alerts performing hunting or some type of investigation then the lab is a must we aren't talking about just running desktop virtualization software and creating a few vmc or there that's something that's very nice to have in use but it isn't a lap a lab is Hallmark by being and isolated environment where you don't have to worry about contaminating the data you collect with extraneous data related to your normal system this lecture is all about creating a lab that is more formalized patient in support of your investigation activities in this video will start with outline some different goals of an NSM lab one-size-fits-all so it's important to think about what you want to get out of the lab for you Planning and Building in front loading this part of the work will pay dividends towards the middle and end of the process once you know what you want it's time to decide on an architecture physical virtual and cloud-based labs diagrams of each top you can work from this step is important because it's where will Define the flow of traffic and how you captured unless you're going with a pure cloud-based solution you'll need some Hardware to run your infrastructure I'll discuss considerations there and make some recommendations from my own lab after that will dive into the software you need to run your lab this one clue. Operating systems and NSM software and here I'll cover the different system roles are recommend having in a lab based upon I'm done in the earlier planning stages of the process I'll describe boy with all the knowledge you need to get started building your lab in a few diagrams and temples that you can work from keep in mind that I'm not just going to throw out a bunch of random Loosely related suggestions what about this video is about taking a systematic approach to design in developing your lab much in the same way that a network administrator would designer real Network the most part what you're creating here important Eufaula every step here if you skip something you might get further down the line and end up getting lost are the materials presented here was carefully chosen to get you to a place highly functional NSM lab that meets all your needs defrauding details in my own personal lab including a complete parts list and network diagram couple of other network diagrams you can use a starting point as well as can be found in the resources link provided with this video again I'll be showing you exactly what I run in my own lab this is the exact Lab at sitting next to me on the table as we speak now that's to say that my lab may not be the perfect setup for everybody that works for my needs and I think various iterations on it will work for yours probably as well
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:72: the first really critically important thing I want to talk about is setting the goals for your lab if you're an innocent man was most of your lab work will probably fall into one of three categories signature development malware analysis and simulations development is something most analyst do to feed the detection mechanisms that generate alerts within their environment horse out of this is usually going to be with more signature-based intrusion detection systems like snort cercado some cases Advanced side you might be using custom scripts within the Bro framework for building a tuning signatures I just want to learn more about it then you're going to want systems deployed with all these Technologies even if you're just responsible for validating investigating alerts it's helpful to have these tools available so you can replay traffic through them to make sure that the results you're getting are expected it's not uncommon for an analyst to get a peek at from a source outside your monitoring visibility window and want to replay it through a detection mechanism to see if anything alerts is all very important things now while it may take awhile for newer analysts to get to this point eventually also need to be able to understand what a particular piece of malware does what its capabilities are what its potential is the different nasty effects of can have on your system level you want to take a suspicious file and throw it into a sand box for basic static in behavioral analysis Google for determining if malware has been installed on a system and for building signatures based on newly discovered samples skilled you might want to use your lab to conduct your own manual static and behavioral analysis to dive deeper as well suffered in many cases you won't know if something is anomalous until you can compare it to something normal this is perhaps the greatest value in having a lab because it gives you a place to stand up normal systems introduce a stimulus and review the response scenario where you observe a system sending a lot of weird-looking Skype John Skype user in might otherwise be hard to find a sample to prepare what the traffic is online you know you don't know what a normal Skype traffic looks like and even if you did if you did run Skype it may be difficult to separate that out from the normal traffic you running on your system and that can certainly be very time-consuming what system in your lab you can stall Skype and quickly generate the sample for comparison and kind of an isolated scenario without a bunch of extra data or variables great deal investigating security alerts is all about being able to discern what is normal versus what is abnormal in addition to this you can also conduct simulations of attacks abilities releasing you need to stand up a vulnerable system in a day do this in your lab just as an attacker with the information of Czar from the attack you can build detection based upon the traffic captured log generated and operating system this is a very common workflow in most organizations she hasn't evolved such to a point yet where as soon as a new vulnerabilities announced the detection is being announced with it right so in this case listen to your lab run it run the simulation and see what that is generated then you could build a signature out of it this is something most reasonably secure secure and will do so you should spend some time considering your job role in which of these scenarios you're most likely to spend your time doing they're all related to some degree simulations are used to tune signatures and malware analysis is a form of stimulation when doing Behavior Analysis very interrelated and you may do very little of one and much of another or you may do very little of all these things with important to understand what your workflow is and where the lab can help you in these endeavors another way to think about this by considering your expected in
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:77: your job is probably defined by the type of data you take as an input and the desire to Outline Three really common input and output scenarios that I think irrelevant to most analysts first most famous responsible for reviewing alerts done this at some point some of you may do this exclusively or some of you may do it just as a small part of your job but you may need to take an alert that's that comes from a signature-based IDs or some form of Sommore next-gen firewall or something like that take that alert and run it to ground do your investigation she really wanted to determine one is the alert a true positive false positive I certainly was a true positive then you want to escalate that and act on it and then you know too if the false positive you probably need to be there you know Builder tunes on top of a signature to prevent that from happening again and optimize your time so in this case the alert is your input and either this disposition or a tomb signature is probably your output the goal of the lab is to help you get from input to Output better or quicker and in this case it's probably going to take the form of some type of stimulation they would allow you to do that in a second scenario your handed a packet capture file as your input need to make a determination on whether it's malicious another disposition type judgment and whether you need to build a tuna signature I need might be handed a peacock for a number of reasons you know outside of the scope of your normal centigrade in your normal detection I might come from from place you just don't have a sensor or might be from a sensor where something was missed but you needed to catch it and so you're replaying that pcap through through new technology and given to you by a client and that way so in this case the lab pills are all providing you the ability to replay the pcap through your sensors in various detection mechanisms to get to the output you want the third scenario have here is some of the last been sitting behind a packet capture being handed an actual file and again you want to determine a disposition is it malicious is a malware or is it been on and then what you do that you make a decision about whether you need to build a tuna signature to catch the catch this type of file catch a better maybe like a Yaris signature or something like that is it opposed to after-the-fact so just take the lab provides a role that will allow you to detonate that found a Sandbox to Canada achieved the desired output you want there the gist of this is that if you can identify your comment inputs and outputs then you should be well-equipped to figure out what rolls your lab can feel to help you get from input to Output which is really important Juniper use examples of outline the model you can use to plan out your lab again we want a front load the planning work here so the actual work of building the lab goes much smoother if you don't do this you're really run yourself a risk of getting overwhelmed during the the process of purchasing a hardware or building out the lab itself and really never
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:79: get it done this what happens to most people I see is they just they just get into it and they get really overwhelmed because they didn't do the planning ahead of time and that can really affect your ability to it to get through this and it's certainly some work to get the lab planned and built up once you do it's so valuable and will really be helpful to you in your daily job and really for advancing your career in your education as well so you're fighting yourself and your own psychological limitations here as much as anything else to to get this bill so the framework early requires you ask yourself 3 fairly simple questions what inputs do you receive do you simply review alerts or do you have to perform analysis of peak apps and files from internal external sources second what outputs are you expected produce is your job only to determine if alerts weren't escalation or you involved in the creation of two native detection mechanisms as well at this point it's also worth considering whether you're responsible for just a single network network of the organization you work for or if you're working for some type of consultancy where you're required to provide maybe some more detailed report and recommendations and things like that those are outputs you should consider finally what technologies are needed to get you from inputs that you've identified to the output you need this one click specific Technologies like intrusion detection systems operating systems malware analysis tools data collection and Analysis tools and more and also if you're basing your lab off of your production Network you should try to mirror those Technologies in your lab really as much as possible remember that part of your goal is to create a representative sample of the network you're defending that's where the science of this kind of comes into play when you're finished listing the technology needed in your lab you should be able to bruselas like this example
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:80:*** Technology example list
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:81: I've shown here on the screen now in this example this we see that will need several different tools and operating systems available to cover the range of use cases that will support our work so in this case we see a lot of popular detection related Technologies like snort netsniff-ng for packet capture bro silk for flow capture a cuckoo sandbox for malware detonation of Behavioral analysis a couple of analysis tools like squeal to look at various alerts flow bat to dig into netflow traffic from systems generally going to be design I replicate things that are in the production environment that we're working from or really just that things are interested in knowing more a few different varieties of the Windows operating system Windows domain controller so in that case you can actually create your own domain and examine traffic between the domain controller and domain domain clients as well as and the lamp Linux Apache web server so a lot of variety here through this portion of the exercise to make your own similar list in general actually recommend doing that first even maybe even before watching the rest of this video I've provided a worksheet in the resources section that you can use to make a list similar to this this one that I have here this example  no first really big implementation decision that you'll need to make will be related to the architecture platform you're using namely will you build your lab with physical devices virtual machines or the virtual cloud images voices has their own pros and cons so let's review those platform option you have to consider is a physical lab that relies on Hardware being built represent a fully functional Network this is probably that use case that most people might jump to first because of course this represents what you're used to think about when you think of a real functional net worth buying physical computers and servers installing operating systems systems as well as purchasing installing networking gear Lycra you're actually in this case literally building a real Network right I know this has the benefits of allowing you to learn Concepts they can apply to real Network management which is certainly a plus and it can also provide flexibility to reconfigure the network by physically plugging and unplugging Hardware in at different places to change the network topology apart can be a plus or minus depending on where your interests lie now imagine the biggest drawbacks here in terms of flexibility and cost you can find cheaper low and Hardware pretty easily on eBay or in local auctions that cost can still out up really quickly especially if you need to run several versions of modern Windows operating systems which need I've been some of the junk you literally found at a thrift store down if you have to rebuild the operating system of physical machine from time to time for instance if you're running malware generally when you run malware you're going to want some type of snapshot and capability so that you can revert to before the matter was executed and not have to rebuild the operating system every time I would have standard physical machine some others have a backup option but I really would be very time-consuming and not to feasible machines don't provide any type of Snapchat if you mess something up or are need xq malware all the physical lab maybe that's the first thing that comes to mind for a lot of people I can't think of many actual use cases were physical lab would make the most sense it's just not really very cost-effective doesn't give you the flexibility you need certainly simpler if you're familiar with real Network architecture design but again I just can't think of any use cases where you would want to do that so for that reason in this video we're not really going to talk about physical labs the next platform option you have to consider
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:83: is through a cloud provider there a lot of cloud providers out there now Amazon web services AWS for starting the biggest Microsoft provides is your Rackspace has their own cloud offering and that certainly makes one option for deploying a lab this technology allows you to deploy systems based on Virtual images of either vanilla or pre-configured operating systems play pre-configured operating system to start cuz it can increase your efficiency Nobu to server you can deploy in a boon to server running nodejs in mongodb already freaking figure sets time you're not having to spend doing that yourself which is certainly valuable and unique benefit to to Cloud base lab is essentially the model will vary depending upon the the provider for the most part your pain based upon their resources your allocating to these machine with some multiple of the resources there and then you paid based upon your actual nothing employee system in a cloud-based environment You're simply choosing an operating system image selecting the processing disc and memory resources you'll need providing a few basic pieces of identity information depressing go right it's as simple as that the machine is usually built in a matter of seconds and you can log into it as soon as it's it's built as it were a normal device because you can bring systems up and down so quickly a cloud-based lab probably the greatest degree of flexibility in that regard which is one of the main reasons parts of their infrastructure they need to rapidly expand or contract based upon changing infrastructure needs things like a web infrastructure high peak times are in Peak demand seasons which cloud provider has their own unique cost model but most of them center around paying for based upon resources you need for individual lab systems usually don't need a gigantic systems this cost shouldn't get too out of hand with just a few systems if you're building a reasonably sized lab call even for most normal folks then it cost can increase pretty rapidly in cases like that the cloud lab will probably end up costing you more than a Virtual Lab which a Virtual Lab but we'll talk about next but it's important to understand that that cost relationship there because of the cloud lab is certainly a continual cost so you'll you'll be paying for it for the most part on day one is much as you'll be paying for it on day you know 500 I know it's worth mentioning that one of the bigger sticking points with cloud-based Labs is that their networking options are limited specifically most providers don't give you a mechanism for capturing packets from a group of devices that's what the normal Network you know you ever a switch with a span port and you would run things through that switch it would it would span the port disconnecting the Upstream router and then you would get everything going Upstream you don't have that option with in the cloud there that'll make Cloud TAPS in most cases they may eventually but right now so that means package on its own local to those individual machines this is a couple problems with this I never wanted that increases the storage footprint of those machines that you act restoring increase your cost if you have to go around every individual machine to collect all the package you want we had it certainly going to decrease your efficiency there and appreciate your desire to use the lab now we're running loud exploits is a part of a simulation as the malware processes in the XY code May render the target system inaccessible running a packet capture on a machine and then you run an export against it and it crashes machine you're not going to have a good ability to get the packets out of it you're going to lose those and that's that's not a good scenario so or really time of Engagement if you just have a short reason you need to set up something and try something without a lot of advanced networking needs cloud looks great that said it's still not what I use it's not what I would recommend for the most General use case I'm generally going to prefer a Virtual Lab which is what we'll talk about next and focus on for the rest of this video last but not least is the option for a virtual platform which is by far the most popular in using in the labs in the folks I know have labs and it's definitely what I recommend for for the vast majority of folks talk about really for the rest of this video is the process of Designing a Virtual Lab because I really believe it's it's probably the best and most cost-effective option
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:85: at a small scale you can setup a Virtual Lab by installing what's called a type 2 hypervisor like VMware Workstation or Fusion on an existing system that will I didn't create virtual systems that you install an operating system on to interact with him like you would have big physical system that works fine how large are more long-term scenarios and data collection primarily because of limited resources available on the desktop and the potential to contaminate your data collection with normal traffic we kind of hit up on this a bit earlier that's not really a lab it's way too quickly run things up and you can certainly run simulations and and run some detection that way but it's really not the most ideal scenario for First Estate isolation there so for your lab you'll actually most mostly be concerned with what we call type 1 hypervisor like VMware esxi are xenserver in this scenario you install these platforms onto a bare-metal system with the sole purpose of Hosting virtual machines so you don't necessarily install an operating system like Windows and then install the software on top of it the software like being where he has sex to the physical machine it's the only operating system in the virtual machines are then posted from give me about virtual server host is that they are the benefit of being incredibly flexible and also very cheap you can build a virtual host for lab purposes It's very effective for you know around $8,500 at the low in which we need a lot of folks needs and even with that $500 system once it's built you can host dozens of virtual systems on them and so here in a bit I'll give you an example of such a system that they can be built in the resources section include a list of what I've built in my network now the Virtual Lab you can build new systems in a matter of minutes and then you can bring those systems up or down based upon your needs at a given time with with minimal effort so especially monitoring top systems but I know in the case of mine I probably have 50 to 60 virtual machines and I just bring the ones I need to use up or down at any given instant so the way the resources are allocated for the most part I'm not using the available resources unless the machine is running which is a great deal of flexibility and very useful so in addition to this virtual Labs Rod probably the most flexible form of of snapshotting that's available to you you can actually create snapshots with a single click so if you decide you want a snapshot click one button it creates it and you can also restore it with just a couple clicks there you can even create snapshot trees and have multiple Forks of a single virtual machine in different states this is really useful for simulations as well as malware analysis you can create a snapshot snapshot image of the crazies big Laboratories basically the state of a system through many different iterations of of events that may be occurring on it which is incredibly useful I can't I can't overstate how useful that is so you're not having to redo work all the time it's really great now there are only two real drawbacks to Virtual Labs I think was mentioning first is that the platforms themselves sometimes have a bit of a learning curve something like VMware esxi server like it does take a little bit to learn a little bit of how that works and how to get that set up and going it's not too bad but there is one second and the other real drawback is that there's more of an initial upfront investment with a need to purchase the hardware to service the virtual Host this is different than a cloud model you created with Virtual Lab do you have to invest the initial upfront cost for the physical host as well as a couple of networking components routers and switches you'll need to setup your monitoring within the scope of your eye your existing Network always recommended Virtual Lab for the purposes of the defensive security practitioner and the rest of this video I'll Focus exclusively on building a virtual lab and that'll include the consideration she need going forward from a hardware and software perspective as well as some recommendations on different platforms and exact steps you should go through to build your lab and kind of a systematic way that will ensure success of the end of the UN allowed that will be great for your own needs virtual Labs that should help you we start speaking out the hardware you're going to need for your Virtual Lab you should start by drawing it out on paper now you don't need to spend a lot of time making it very pretty and getting all the colors riding Alliance trading something like Vizio but you should at least put something down on a white border in a notebook everything where I wanted and wild boars really conducive to that I want you finalize it later you can make it pretty in and do the Vizio so to do this I recommend three three fairly simple steps start from the internet and move inward or Downstream most of your probably gonna be building your Virtual Lab at home so apologies probably pretty simple you probably have just a single modem or router or maybe their combined but this is probably as simple as starting by drawing a you known as fluffy cloud the internet and drawing a line from it to your external router and then from there you can you can move in work and draw lines were things connect we start drawing things out this is where the list you created earlier really comes into play if you remember you should have created a list that basically had every technology and service that you're going to need in your lab your next task is to Production Service you have listed there and put it into your diagram as if it were a physical system in a real Network you can place eat service individually to start with or if you know where you want to combine things you can certainly do that where make sense Branson's if you know you'll be running a web server and a sequel server those theoretically could obviously and you can have to decide if that makes sense for you or if you want them separate for instance if you want to capture packets going in between them to represent something that maybe on your real system as another example of something like security onion to have all your monitoring Technologies like that's if Angie and snort and bro or you can have those separately as well if you think your you have a good know what you figure out where called consolidation can exist your next step is to draw the network connections in a way that is conducive to the data you want to capture this could be as simple as grouping all your virtual systems together in a flat Network and configuring your sensors to intercept traffic between those systems and the internet and how to divide your systems in the multiple networks so you can play sensors that can capture traffic between Network segments as well as between them and the network and the internet this of course is going to represent them more real world Network children all this out you should have an architecture map basic crating architecture map that you can use to build your network not loading to work when you get to the process actually building networking had reference the process should go really really quickly shortly will go to the process of setting that up but let's the Torso get a couple of examples so as
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/investiagtion.org:87: and I said starting out will jar network from the outside working in word again if you're doing this at home your network diagram is probably look as simple as this right you have the internet you have your router and that's your start very easy next going to take all the things from our list and then this is based on the list we used in the earlier slide and place all the systems that are needed in this case I have 3 servers and three clients I've done some some consolidation in that regard and then these are all the other production systems right so we haven't got to the monitoring infrastructure so that's next finally here we're going to modify the network designed to account for the monitoring technology we need and make sure that's reflected example we done quite a bit of consolidation on the sensor side and again we can probably do something like security onion to achieve this level of consolidation I hear all the virtual machines are plugged into a switch that is marrying the traffic between them in the router to the sensors find a cuckoo sandbox device as well so this is the simplest way to design a lab you know keep in mind everything you see here other than the router and switch exist on a single piece of hardware on the single virtual host that includes the sensors the cuckoo sandbox and all of the servers and clients we have available so this is probably for most home users doing doing a symbol now considering the same set of requirements this is an example of how the same lab could be designed in a much more advanced than kind of dispersed way again we're working from the same list but we've lay things out more real world so to speak here we place the web and mail servers and they demilitarized zone the DMZ that separated from the domain controller in the clients to support this we have an extra router and switch a series of sensors sensors which have been broken out into more individual virtual machines based upon their roles is really more similar to an actual corporate production network based on the way things are segregated out Atmore granularity and dealing with Individual Services and how you can track data moving through the network however this can be accomplished with a single virtual host to the lab setup I run at my house but just level complexity Main most after all with more complex ability does come warm engine overhead and this case you'll need to purchase a few extra pieces of network Hardware as well so this is going to up your cost a little bit too one more final note on network is on here for most of you you'll probably building your lab Network at home many of you will probably just use your lab Network functionally as your home network as well and that's mostly fine but you want more segregation you'll need to do that at that the height Upstream level you can so for example in my network pay my eyes p a few extra bucks a month and they give me a range of static IP addresses this allows me to take my my Broadband modem and plug two different routers into it and get two different static IP addresses I have my home network Downstream from one router and my lab Downstream from another router if I need to do something on the lab Network I can just physically plug a laptop into that Network or join the wireless network I have set up avail so you can get on that so for me for my purposes I wanted to have that complete level of segregation but for most that might not be an issue motion may just want to run it independently again you want to make sure you have at least enough segregation to make sure your local browsing traffic isn't polluting the network after you're taking for you this is just another way to to get to the goal of having a more flexible lab now that you know what your lab network will look like it's time to start speaking up
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/ELK/DATA-in-ES.org:3:This lesson really going to start and diving into elasticsearch Hands-On into talk about all the basic action only want to take related to any database and that's what we call crud which stands for create read update and deletes I'm going to go through examples of all these dealing exclusively with elasticsearch now if you remember from earlier I mentioned that elasticsearch provides restful API access and that's an important concept to understand as we begin to interact with elastic search for the really defines the way in which we interact with the data that we have stored in our database database and we're going to interact with it with an HTTP client we say something is restful that means were interacting with HTTP M Points so if you're familiar with how HTTP works and if your insecurities you're probably are to some degree we have this concept of request methods and response codes that means we will make a request in this case we can make a get request for the root directory of the web server and the server is responsible for responding to that request hopefully for our purposes is the 200 okay status code along with the data we requested so the fact that we're using HTTP client really opens up a lot of doors for some reason people like developing Tools around elasticsearch so much that's really easy that a lot of blackberries out there that can be used for interacting with things play Piazza just an easy way to interact with data now in H-E-B client of course can be a lot of things one of those things is curling that's what we did in the example earlier when we set up elasticsearch and tested to make sure it worked we used to curl and requested the root directory 2 / of the elasticsearch instance to verify that was responding and it was so curl is a text-based httpclient quiet is a browser so Chrome isn't even over browser I could very simply put the address of the elastic search database into my browser and requested and get information that way and that's another way to go beyond that we have web applications that we can use so by using our browser and using Chrome we can use something like kamana which we can issue commands to and then it will take our request interpret those format them appropriately for elasticsearch and request that at War insert dad or someone we can use it for all of the credit functionality week read update and delete data off of these Russell interaction so if you not dealt with a lot of restful interaction than this may seem kind of new to you that's fine we're about to get into some examples using this right now I'm dialed into my elk server here and I just want to make sure
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/ELK/DATA-in-ES.org:6:that elasticsearch is up and running so I'm going to go ahead and do PS aux and grip for that and it does look like elasticsearch is running a little bit here too so I want to make sure it's running I'm sure enough it looks like it is also make sure that these things are listening on the network just by doing that's that Dash antp went to see what we have here it does look like yes we have Port 9200 running locally so that's elasticsearch 5601 listening as well so that is for cabanis all those things are running which means we should be good to go as far as using and interacting with elasticsearch & Gabbana kabana remember we not done anything to this instance I like going on so if I go up here and go to the Discover section where I would generally expect to be able to run a search up here it says index patterns please specify a default index pattern and that he is unable to fetch mapping do you have in this in this these matching the pattern part of this and we'll see the same similar messages getting any data being kicked to this man configure an index pattern page and the reason for that is because we don't have any data in here yet there's nothing for it to show so come on is only useful if there's data in our database that we can enter 8 through so if we want to get data in here we have to manually put it in or you some other third-party application wish we had to manually put that in so you can understand a little bit of this structure of how these working how were putting and getting them from the elastic search index not to do that we're going to go here to this Dev tools option and we have a very simple console organ input commands hit display button and get the results of those right there this is what we're going to focus on here for the next little bit and you already seen me run or testing to make sure elasticsearch was installed properly is flash just going to request the root directory of the web introduce some outputs I'm going to go ahead and hit this we do get response back from elasticsearch so we know we are connected to elasticsearch nor able to interact with it this is some very basic output the last search for buys just about the cluster name the uid version and information and so on so there's not a lot here that's useful to us in terms of data we're going to search and do something with data now to do that we're going to use command which is an HTTP method is used to upload data to a server and we're going to use it to put data into our elasticsearch instance here and we do this as take a very specific format going to list the name of the index we want to certain that's insert data into I'm going to choose our athletes index building off of a previous example we talked to her from there we have to list the type that we are putting the data into ruin indexes and then we have types so I'm going to insert a basketball player in here so I'm going to go for the basketball type from there I'm going to specify a unique identifier for the document for which I'm just going to use the identifier one I can make this multiple digits I can actually even leave it off and a random identifier would be assigned but for this purpose I'm going to go ahead and Assad and identifier here the important that's the header string here where I'm saying that I want to put a document into at the athletes index the basketball type and a sign of the number one the identifier one I need to actually put the document that I want to answer so I'm going to go ahead and paste this in here this is again from a previous example notices this is Json format it so we begin our object with curly braces and end with curly braces and then we have a list of keyvaluepair so we have the field last name and the value Curry the first name field and that you stepped in some once we have five Fields were inserting here now this is properly formatted that you may have seen pop-up noticed that if I just put a random character here I get an error that it expected something different so I'll give her that everything looks good and I'll hit the play button get back his response from elasticsearch which tells me that this was essentially successful and it goes back to me the index which is athletes the type which is basketball the ID which is one and a little bit of other metadata one is version number of the document that I just answered if it's a brand new documents of the number is 1 the result tells me this was created I got a little information about shards elasticsearch management feature that would make her a little bit later and then I finally get created equals true so know that this was successfully inserted into the database and that data should know actually exist for me to ask to access the data we're going to change things around a little bit first of all I can get rid of the document I just inserted I don't need that anymore put HTTP method I'm going to change it to get I remember we used it earlier to get the information and tested the elastic search are results going to tell it to get use the same format get / index / type / ID if I hit the play button on this we get the results back and we get the data we just insert it we have submitted out of here we have index athletes type basketball id-1 version one we have and output that says found is true so that the data was actually found and then we had this underscore Source object here where and we get the actual document we inserted so this is that same Player information Define an object's this is within a bigger object bigger object contains the metadata about are searching about the index and type and the internal object is actually the document we were searching for so that's that gives us the data we want and what we can do here as well as I can add another / here and your score Source input and noticed that's the name of this song never hit play only going to get the Json document we're not going to get all of that we're going to get this specific object related to the data we have started we're not going to get all that other and depending on what the output goal of your searches this may be something that you you're using for for whatever reason but that's the underscore Source input to get the data we just inserted and only that. what does it look like if we search for data that maybe doesn't actually exist in our index at a trot so here I'm going to do it but instead of ID one which we know exist for the ID to within the basketball type in the athletes index we get a response back so you actually get data back but in this case it echoes back our index are type in our ID and tells us found is false and no other data is so that's why we have to work with me know that Paxil for programmatically Keen off of that for some reason weekend similarly we can we get some more responses back at some grief we search for maybe an index that doesn't exist so if I search for the DFI are index and hit plate weed a little bit more data but it basically equates to the fact that there is no index found here so we see we have an error we have recalls information index not found exception no such index a little bit more information at go back to us and we actually even get a 404 status Air which is akin to Dad and I found our file not found in HTTP Response Code went so back to you when you search for something or try to retrieve data that does not actually exist now we just tried to search for ID too and it didn't exist so it's actually go ahead and practice inserting data One More Time by creating specify are athletes index to notice how Cabana is actually Auto feeling that for us now that it knows that index exist I'm going to do put into athletes indexed to our basketball type Heidi too and will taste in here are next document which is John Wall the point guard for the Washington Wizards rated truths we know that data was inserted successfully so let's go ahead and Echo that data back by changing this put to agate I turned off we get the data back we can also go ahead and add this Source in point and just get the actual data without the metadata associated with it so here once again we're able to index data into elasticsearch and then retrieve that data back talk about updating data in this case let's say that John Wall who plays for Washington gets traded will say he gets traded to I don't know Dallas
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/ELK/DATA-in-ES.org:9: 2 watt to accomplish this 215 here is where making a pope pushed to the update in point for the athletes index basketball type id2 and then were specifying the field we want to change which is here is if it's if we go back to the previous exams are documents that reindexed want to make a settled and that one's going to be pretty straightforward so let's say we've been working with object ID number to hear which is this John Wall basketball player so what we're actually going to do is delete him so we don't want him in our index in and execute that it's going to tell us that the item was found it's going to go back to the index type and ID to us in the version the result is that this was deleted and delete was successful and we can verify that by changing delete to get and sure enough found is now false we know this was actually properly deleted that data no longer exist that particular ID was deleted and doesn't exist in this index anymore HTTP method can be used quite a bit more aggressively what you sow I want thing we can do is we can actually delete our entire athletes index in this is probably not something you're going to be doing a lot of is deleting entire Nexus released in this course where you're playing around with things you messed up I want to be able to do so I'm going to delete our athletes index here and noticed that it says acknowledged true in this case so let's go ahead and verify let's try to get the athletes saw the basketball type and ID one which is one week individually deleted now tell us indexes not found and that's because the the index has been deleted it's no longer there so we're back to where we started where in there is no data in this elasticsearch in set for back now one of the trick that might come in handy for you to question I'll get asked a lot as well how do I list all the available in to see them not finding the data I want I want to make sure mine this Seas well that's a pretty easy one of theirs and .44 that as well so I'm going to do get underscore cat which is just basic in a list out specific features of certain I'm going to tell it to cat out the you hear when I play in this case the only to see that exist as the actual. Kabana one which is the default one that comes the gets installed when you configure a cabanis there actually no other in to see if there were other ones those would show up so that's actually go ahead and recreate are in to see here for athletes I'm going to go ahead and put this in here and we for recreated are athletes miss a notice our version starts back at number one because it's a new index that document have been deleted so it's not going to be incrementing versions in that case get the list of indices again we now have our athletes Embassy here with all the associated metadata a Twitter that that is now available to us know that about wraps up here but I do want to show you one more thing just a circle back to something I talked about earlier about how when are using restful apis are a lot of different ways to with something like elasticsearch and we've been doing that to the browser here with kabana but we can actually go back and do that with curl as well and I just want to show a quick example in a way that you can actually get those commands made for you very easily and I'm going to go ahead and show you something we already looked at clearing the ID number one which is one of our athletes we've been started into this index what I'm going to do now is click this Carl I'm going to click that and after I do that I'm going to switch over to our command line here and I'm going to paste this in so this is what was copied and it should look familiar this is how we tested elasticsearch using curl - x get good as the method and its case it's specifying base of the same thing we just queried but with the appropriate connection string enter here and we get the exact same result back that we got back lactation the same command but we're not browser and this to show you how easy it is interact with so many tools are built on top of it you can very easily write a python script that could do this and really rot a hole analysis tool kit from a python from very simple Python scripts that just use existing HTTP libraries to interact with an elastic search database the TV is interacting with a typical relational database such as I see cooler or something like that and maybe even depend on your perspective a little bit easier than that so probably this lesson has been really helpful to you as we've gone through and looked at all of these different types of interactions starting to interact with and get her hands dirty on with using elasticsearch pop-up this first really Hands-On lecture we've had with elasticsearch we learned a lot of the core things that we're going to build on through the rest of Ichabod and from there we did basic crud operations of data data

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/with-out-ref.org:2: Drink and then post filter in order to do that I wanted to just go in, now that's pretty much the quickest way to do that what we're going to work with is thick that is the log ID to find for what we're worried about that's to H-E-B info record the correlations between the two going to work with the default filter aggregated new one we're just going to work on the existing one easier and we'll add it back in after we change him look at what the data looks like right now so go ahead and run http look at the hdb log so we see all the columns request body length enclosed always zero right very very close to always here so do we care about that you see a lot of these are the dash which is we talked about input framework that means I know what means the entry is not in there so do we care about that well some of these have a little more than zero so maybe we do maybe we don't know password or username there's not a secure info message info code so maybe we should exclude those excluding the request body length what's playing on Comet this out and see what it does and what's not enable to predicate yet let's just work on exclusions Ghost Rider it's not a massive pcap just big enough to give us the data we're after so we excluded what we exclude a request underscore body underscore length well it's Grill through here while we see response body length appear to have excluded that so just a demonstrative info message also so this is a set info and info message I apologize for not typing it right the first time let's look at the values we get back we don't have it would have been right here for the previous log file there is no info code or info message so whatever you done here is actually reduce week what we've actually done here the volume of rhcp long because we are getting rid of fields that at least by our test day that we see right now your mileage may vary on your network don't have this day. We don't have tags no it's all gone and conversely we could actually do that for all of these and just completely clean this up and just have the bare minimum of what we know we're getting values back for and beyond that not lose much sleep over it very powerful thing to do what we also going to do is so let's look here we have refers right and we have some that don't have her first maybe we only care about maybe the network say we're looking at we only care about H-E-B connections that have a refer and so we're going to do is add the predicate the filter press Chase HP info record because that matches it up with the log idea of HDPE calm calm and if the record exists this will violate to true and false true and true else return false if you want to keep the row the line of data we with a Vlog we were turn true that keeps it otherwise return false and that gets rid of it so if we look at so we're going to filter the refer the referred is not exist let's Scroll of it right here so that means this first entry should be gone because there is no refer that means this entry should be gone 3 so there's a handful and as we look through here and go ahead and run and we should not see the very first entry because of her fur does not exist right it is gone here we don't see anything that is not which is very very helpful right but conversely let's say we want to that doesn't have a refer so will negate that we should only see entries have no refer alright these are all the entries that sometimes looking at the negative side of what your initial e looking at actually gives you the results you're you want keep that in mind as you go through here sometimes negating something will give you the data you actually want something to compare and contrast two which is and just as helpful conversely King on the ACP log for hdb log what if we only want the timestamp to uid the year I we want to exclude Clute that's a set and we want that timestamp ID URI and nothing else that's all we want over ICP maybe it's a special pcap they were looking at just very specific things and we only have those things that we were after it's a very very very powerful thing to have very helpful so that gives you a flavor of the logging capabilities at bro as a review of them I should say but it actually gives you Jerry you of what you can do for logging when you're logging you don't have to settle with what you're just being given you can actually down select you have a path variables to be able to send data to different files you can down select you can compute those paths you can bulk change them yeah probably gets to filter and exclude specific line items and you can have sets that include specific columns or exclude specific columns definitely all things to experiment with try bro is a great resource to do that in because you can click about and find the details before you actually start implementing lunch sensor so effective a free playground environment there is no harm in doing that actually it's a great approach in general examples in the previous I showed you the templates calculate the templates to lease start out with the look through if you understand how to pull and find records a filled-in records excuse me then filter and becomes very straightforward the existence of a record or the non-existence of a field in a record scuse me enlarged where your filtering comes in certain interval ranges of that data is the other side of it we I did show previously the connection threshold I showed filtering and talked about filtering ahead of this section just to give you another layered example of the filtering capabilities that is a big one at this point the the cart before the horse because fairly easy because the sections built on top of each other it's hard to show them in the proper order because you want to build a bill do certain sections and show the is between sections of why they exist necessitates that hat but this was the filtering section demonstration for brow and hopefully it gives you a really good idea of some very quick very straightforward ways of cleaning up your logs reducing the volume of your logs again it's great to put on everything you start getting the point of turning things off and down that's when the real work starts that's what filtering let you achieve in a very timely fashion and a very Dynamic way
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/vector.org:3:vectors in bro another container type definition of vectors like a table that fits always index bike injector indexing is always zero based in battery declared like Global fee is Vector of strength so V is a vector contains drinks very simple deconstructor how much did the example in the set so local Vehicles Vector 1 definition of gullible that's a factor of type string zero based indexing is V is provided by example print V2 would be the 2nd the number to internet the second entry the number to entry about 1 2 3 entry 0 indexing would be 3 be aware that if you come from a language that is not zero indexed this will what will take a second for you to remember if you come from see people's plus this will be the second second hand to you won't even think about elements to be added to Victory by sign the value or exist at the index will be overwritten Sobe 3 equals 4 as you see here there isn't one it's one to 37012 there's no x-rays or just asked if we were to say the two equals four three would be replaced by 4 the number of elements of electricity the absolute operator save this is the length operator for this container a vector of integral types so and Account Support the Prien current richest plus plus with a pre decorated decrement each element in the vector interesting can be helpful and something to be aware of inscription may never use it but you might see in somebody else so you're reading that that's what it's actually doing just be aware of it Dexter's are very powerful there are with medication use against them double can be operands in the recliner operator plus-minus oxy multiplication division modulo but both operators must have the same number of elements can I be used either operators adventure of a double before we Define with rhythmatic operators were in a modulo is not able to be used against dump resultant Vector can dance the result of the operation apply to each of the elements in the Opera and back very powerful thing it's very thick of a matrix operations to an extent and that might set in your mind was what's happening or you just are less you're trying to do some statistical analysis you may not use this ever but for familiarity purposes I don't want you to be aware they exist vectors allow for duplicate entries in the introduction to sat I said they cannot actors do their very fast make some allows for some optimizations if you're trying to collect up I mean can that that bad actor IP address did something against a specific Port umbrella today you can use a vector to collect those up so over this this window of time event happened 500 times based on me collecting up their IP address let's say into this vector Adam all up never nice summation functions go through have it all up pronounce results analysis doctors are you're going to want to go to use demonstration of vectors and bro and how to manipulate them add to them and deal with them now we're going to start again with bro in it credit local verb it is a type vector and in order to send text her back to her so you say it's a vector but it's a vector of what Vector of count after string Vector outer Vector of potentially something along those lines what's it what's to a vector of count and that alone is enough to initialize a vector that is a vector just ran no errors you're going to probably have some kind of initialization and that is very handy to have we will do this so now we know to better account similar to a set using curly brackets and now it should be a vector of 4 Prius 1 2 3 4 but remember a vector is is indexed zero based indexing initializing a vectors handy is you have to know the length of the vector have to know the size of the vector and if you're going to add things to the vector nuances to that ways to do that is to Simply go in so will say vector and we're going to go to the length of the vector set that equal to 5 and that's how you add into a vector there's not an ad operate you have to be very explicit at what point in the vector you're adding something it's not a container that which you could just kind of keep shoveling things in and it is something appears you have to manage the length of the back here to manage the vector in an explicit manner in order to do that you need to length operator which so it's an absolute value operator you'll see that it's also the length of a and this case so what does this actually explicitly doing is saying okay I want to put Envy at this index so this is the index the way you index into the vector the length of it is before was but but remember it's zero indexed so really that's the fifth place so 03 the length is actually 4 by zero indexing we're going to put the number 5 is your indexing if you're new to all this zero indexing it's just becomes cs101 but but trust me this is it is zero index so this is this is actually 0 1 2 and 3 so by putting in the length of it we end up with or so at offset 4-0 base which is actually in indexing would be space 5 we're going to put the number 5 how you in a you add into a vector can a little bit weird but very very well and conversely if you want to actually print out anything access any entry in the vector CV 0 we should get back it's on the index 0 we should get back to number 1 output is 1 analogous to is this is the explicit definition of a vector we can actually be implicit based on the contents of the vector based on the of the vector Construction please be a little more implicit about it run that in that I would see these are the equivalence is there a coolant there difference in Texaco London execution Constructor and we're adding in a bunch of counts is the same as being expected explicit this is a vector of count in here at the initial initial as you with these with this content that is a vector and brown very straightforward since it is zero indexed you're guaranteed your order and you're guaranteed to allow you can actually duplicate entry so you could have a vector of all one's all twos what have you and it's great for counting up things like that so those are vectors in bra
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/use-schedule.org:2: sweet and simple to understand schedule and the nuances behind which you could actually use it that's really what all of those but that's the goal is just to kind of give you an idea the schedule for get started here as a means of just routinely riding out something wrong something maybe a cleanup of an event in your ear framework maybe your building out her routinely logout a Proof of Life of your sensor to a log that is dead admit it out otherwise for a very specific reason and nothing nothing to admit you have to think of his you know it says good know some kind of stoplight tide chart with in your sensor for some reason red green yellow something along those lines maybe your tracking some of your health intern of your sister somehow or your determining that is the basis of your health of your network perhaps and you want to build a report that out can have window ain't understand down such that was time-stamped and you have everything you need there it's on your network it's been a good reason have schedule maybe others may have a long as there are an infinite number of reasons you'd want to do something like this to minimize that would be kind of laughable but it is it is definite very powerful very useful and something to consider using and bro for any number of reasons first one is when he's exercise traffic again that's our ever-present go to for good reason we're going to create an event so crater on custom event that takes no argument in Prince a message that's a caveat to and that's something you have to be a little bit aware of yeah that's that's a note schedule events must reschedule themselves the event handler see you first schedule it you are scheduled at more like in bro in it correct and then went in the event when it fires at the very end the last thing if you will the return schedule itself again and if you want to schedule event clearly that's not what you want to do you want to see have a loop and this is how you do that for a little bit odd and that's part of what I want to get across to you is not the out of the oven but just the the new ones nature of the fact it is how you have to do it for better for worse that's the way it's designed that's what we had to do with a counter to track the number of executions and that's just to prove out a few things here started we have enough I believe to run with well we're going to create our own event takes no arguments will just call it event schedule me none too special just a straightforward and we're going to print out a message that is executing schedule me to actually say event be very explicit here is running they were supposed to have a counter so let's go up to the top and we're going to make a global counters global nothing to see here. They were taking it all and then here we're going to just Priyanka minute and the thing to remember we have to schedule this again I believe I asked you to number 3 we want to schedule the event to run every 3 seconds LSU schedule me wanting to be known of it's a little bit different you have to explicitly say event schedule me it knows if your scheduling something it is an event a little bit different than calling your own custom event something to be a little bit aware of its Al Bernard but that's that's the caveat there that's something you just have to get used to him personally and we have two extra schedule the event to run initially otherwise it will not you'll never execute and now for the last part where to print the resulting count of scheduled events at the end of execution which is just a way of saying it bro dumb we're going to say schedule event schedule me ran Sunday Times and that was the global CNT and that should meet all the criteria we we had listed Robinson scheduling event and then within so just to make this even more obvious within our event schedule me we're going to reschedule ourselves but then obviously was in the curly braces within the body of the schedule the event we're going to reschedule it to run every 3 seconds find a better way to do this for scheduling is you should have a global you should have an exported read affable constant that is an interval obviously that you can read to find someplace else and be able to tweak and changes without having to go in and mess with a script directly that's always the better way to do that we're not worried about that here that's not the goal here but keep that in mind if you design around something like this we use it in the future that's the way you're really going to want to do that more control even if you only ever change it on one deployment for One sensor in the history of the usage of that script you've still more than justify doing it that's the proper design choice we're going to use the exercise traffic as noted and down here running running running now obviously that didn't take 3 seconds execute remember this is this is bro just taking a peek a pit firing it through and it's not doing it really improper real-time it's doing it in artificial real-time which means every 3 seconds it's still every 3 seconds according to the counters and which borough is using not wall clock counters not real time counters is going to actually fire that's scheduled event if you look down we should see the very end but it ran 1880 times obviously quite a bit and that proves out that it did execute quite honestly it printed out very well one of the things you can't really look at the number account login understand what you could do is if you're trying to do this really on the network if you really want to provide your schedule is working it is by large within a a little bit of clocks to you obviously Edge round-offs and justice CIBC computationally on a CPU and in with the shared environments not a real time clock you're not guaranteed scheduling within you nanoseconds to microseconds within a certainly in a round off edge of a interval you could print the start time of the end time and then you can put a clock and every time you go through and just look at that and check that that's fine if you want to do that to prove it out yourself it's fine I promise you this scheduled execution is occurring within a very a fairly usable window of time if you need absolute real time clock Precision you possibly going to have issues in general and you probably don't even do this you want to just look at the raw data and use some kind of outside analysis for the real time clock Precision did you need forensic purposes and reality outside of that that's that's fine if it's perfectly fine forensic purposes you're going to get enough accuracy for missing like this to me how you're using it that it's not going to be a problem you're not going to have any issues with that you're going to get within milliseconds a tourist I'm sure of what you would see otherwise and it will correlate with any kind of maybe might have on your network also to keep that also mind you're going to be able to dial in info the information you're after problem and that is the understanding of schedule very straightforward hopefully the nuances are sinking and of the schedule the fact that you schedule the first and then it's the last line of the schedule event unless you don't want to fire it again which that's fine if you just want to set a timer schedule this event to run and 15 minutes from initial startup which is Factory little do you want that to run one so maybe your network goes from about state to a study analysis State you know inside 15 minutes somehow that's perfectly fine and you want to do that's fine that be a perfect you so just running at schedule event once reoccurring scheduled event it has to reschedule its and that is schedule
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/two-scripts.org:2: this is a little bit of a new one section this is one that comes down to how you want to design your code what are you working on are you trying to build out a new one off framework for any number of reasons and something like this is definitely an example of of that if you want to build your own framework by-and-large you're going to end up using custom events you're going to have things are going to fire like this and things you can register against and this is though you will run across tit any framework you look at is a a grouping of custom events and bra that's from the network code that's from another from another third-party putting out of a framework you want to leverage anything around those knives are going to have custom events so the more comfortable you are with looking at them the better off you'll be in part of the way to do that is actually just to go in and write your own even if they're not the most robust Stellar scary hard things it's still get you think about get you comfortable with reading the code but you can't really understanding what they do and let you understand why so for this one is will use the exercise traffic pcap that's though whole class because it just has so much diverse data in it in a very what about you being a fairly small pcap it still lends itself to being useful across the board two files made up bro and test event at prom so going to that sorry have made it bro bro and will fill that in a bit add event section header the calls the event handler so that I did not give you accident I didn't want to give you that I wanted you to Google I wanted you to look for it I want you to understand and be comfortable with the fact that you're not going to know all of these out of the gate I'm going to put a priority on that just for grins it'll work I'll run it with and without it really does not matter if this but sick of this I'm going to answer it this way from me the right way is if it executes and it will execute for you either way I was testing something when I was when I was so I just added that priority just for grins comfortable something else I wanted to to think about as you go through is the privatization up somebody's handlers how they may affect things and not but I don't want to do it as a mandation because there's enough for you to learn right now without having to think about priority all the things unless it's a specific party laugh but encourage you to look this tried out that way added in or not the right answer this does not include a priority just the way I was thinking about it the way I executed it I put one on there spell beyond new connection Handler we have to think about before I move on to number four is right now if we execute this will not actually see anything from test event. Bro cuz we're not loading it it does not load it by default Triborough not blood type of fault so when we do a load test event and now we loaded now actually get whatever going to put in Testament loaded executed usable Testament we're going to add an export section includes a global event named my test my test event that has a connection argument so we'll go over here to test event name it and we're going to call this where I should go to say this week my test event module export block as I said have a global my test event that had is an event and it takes a connection as its argument we're going to create an event my test event hinder the prince out of the connection as well as it in itself as the my test event we're going to do that within test event what's going to do that organize create that right here so Implement here my test event takes the argument of the connection Siri who's the curly braces connection ID so format my essay test event my test event C equals percent SC Snapple we should connection ID id2 that will take care of that requirement 5 text in Maine. Bro from the new connection event handler we want to call the event handler created and tested abrupt so we want to call this guy and we want to pass the we want to pass in the connection new connection so it's test event in my Testament let's see here we go back here this is where it gets a little bit different you're calling so it's an event my test event test event we're going to pass it the connection otherwise you're just calling them and if you're calling it a venue need to call it like you will call the first you need to call it with a proper arguments I wasn't exposed to end up with an error if you don't eat you can fire an event with no arguments that's fine maybe a great thing to do if your having an an event being used as some kind of car mechanism every time you call it you're increasing a counter somewhere trying to say why you would do that other than using a global function or increasing a global counter but you have the advantage of is an event you can implement it in multiple places and that's kind of beneficial if you just want to have that be part of a framework there's a there's a reason you might want to do something like that but we are number six here we've implemented the inside let's go ahead and see what does ketosis we should end up with a lot of printed out data and we do every new connection we will get caught because we're calling the event handler from new connection new connection the event is defined here they ended test event Bro Army so that's the test event module with my test event event handler and we're passing in a connection and we're bringing it out here so that print is actually coming from obviously here and it is we can prove that the calling of the event we should see nothing printed nothing is printed so that's a clear and easy way to check and make sure what we're assuming to happen happen and it had very much did very much did and that is the answer to this section it is where is a little bit it's a little bit different is you have to call an event say there's an event explicitly you have to Define it as you would a normal event how to create two files really to make this really you know gel together in your head technically body doesn't really have the same impact for learning it's in the same file you still have to call it as an event but you don't really see the power of abusing it this way don't see it as a seed of a framework obviously in this case this is this is hardly a framework this is about as simplistic as you can get but this is the special kind of that seed of a framework how to put together around something in bro something you require internally something you maybe if somebody else talk about you just thought of a great idea when an implement it and share it that would be great and hopefully this gives you some ideas they're on on how to deal with it but that is the answer to create a custom event with two Scripts
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/switch.org:2: Sweet answer to the lab for riding switch statements with break and fall through what you see is the example template in the lab just basic straight away in the Triboro can you welcome to use an editor and the docker container to execute and solve this lab to whichever you're more comfortable with I'm going to use Triboro because it's it's a little bit easier so go ahead and run this just to see what it was our Baseline here I think that's always a good example errors because of a copy and pasting be aware of that I can't really emphasize that enough be very aware of the copy and pasting errors that can occur in Triboro so 2nd and rerun now we have fallen to the bottom that's something to be aware that's why I always do a test run and try bro if I'm copying and pasting out of anything particularly out of Evernote PDF depending on where you're getting code unless it's straight out of a text editor you know when a control you're going to potentially end up with an illegal characters somewhere or some kind of error like that meaning it just there's a control code that the terminal isn't I stripped in the code editor in Triboro and she'll have that problem it's a little bit easier to copy and paste out of original Adam the io or something along those lines and every copy the kobak Albus chances are those others will strip out that the problem child in there and your lunch is fine extra expansion on the on the lab if you ran into that that's why that's what it is the others concerns that's how you saw that so I figured show the error straight away how to do the first part of the exercise is a switch case in my switch for B with a unique message case be Prince I am solving exercise number one of the lab and then it didn't say we were going to fall through adding just a straight-up switch case adding something to a switch you buy a large should assume I know what sections are not happy Pleasant subject but you should assume you're going to just break you're going to just add that one case statement you're going to deal with whatever it is in that case and you'll go about your business and then we are going to so before we were doing my switch bees we're passing be in B did not have a case that's why it fell to the bottom we should get I am solving your size number one of the lad or whatever your message clearly was number 2 is at a fall through over fall through case to my switch for last to use the same logic as default that reads a little bit rough but what it's saying is call through case instead of a break will fall through the keys in the in this instance is the string last and we're going to fall through the default so case last fall thru so I again see in several other languages that use for you just sent the case will take up like this or its blank the logic and the way the in case of see the way they're similar codes generated is it ends up being effectively and no up and up just fall straight through its optimized out doesn't matter into being a default for clarity of the code you'll put the case in but the optimization of the case statement its there bro is obviously not see it does not generate assembly it's a little bit different of an animal in that regard so that being explicit is what we have to be with the fall through to say hey it is going to the next Pacers not assumptions otherwise that kind of goes back to the roots of bro is static and it's it's a little more rigid and that's actually a good thing in your network monitoring software you want rigidity in that respect you don't want it to be so Dynamic that you don't actually know what it's doing and we'll go ahead and just run that just real quick execute why when I'm using it I asked jumping the gun a little bit here but I'm Number 3 run to call my switch and broiling it with a option case be in a zarf the results we've done that so we got you seen the lab call my switch and Brewing it with the option last and deserve the results excuse that based on the fall through will get falling to the bottom falling to the bottom whatever fiber Add a switch case in my switch for early that causes an immediate return so just for grins was AK and we're just going to say return just causes an immediate return so we're not doing anything else we're returning back out that's it and then for number 6 for adding a switch case in my switch for d with an appropriate message what are these you can actually have your order be whatever you want this is the order I wouldn't I would put them in exercise number 6 answer it says nothing else so we're going to actually break unless it's an explicit return or fall through in a case you want to break it's a pretty safe rule to live by and now will call call my switch and we'll all my switch with d animal rennet and we have a error and that's fine is it at or near semicolon line for it's because that should be a colon hopefully you did not make the same mistake but it's it's always good to see what happens when you make an error in a controlled environment early obviously Prince nothing because we're returning back out it's a it's a check early return early no check check later returned often immediately returning back out we obviously could put that case anywhere get the same results as an as an engineer as a software developer you you want to make things as crystal clear and straightforward and it's obvious as you can for yourself say nothing of anyone else so if you're going to have a case a early and it's just going to kick back out immediately I would make it top of the case statement top of the switch the number one case statement as I did hear someplace else clarity first makes the most sense in my opinion we get the exit number 6 answer for the case D that we had and that's the lab for statements with break and fall through Austin overturn for the early case just to give you an idea that executions still occurs returning back out of that the function anything else and again return as you see the mice which function does not have a return it does not take a return type so return is just a way of shorting out the execution of that function or in a case of an event handler in event handler you're just jumping back out of it and continue and execution otherwise someplace else
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/set.org:2: Demonstrate sets and how they work in bra and it's manipulate them we're going to start with r a friend bro in it Houston air and we can do the prototyping further quickly already in the presentation so I'm all set local set ports which we have not necessarily but that's okay just this is a very standard example that you probably if you looked at bro at all you Google broad all you've already seen this and that is a sec that is the notation so the Simplicity here simple and I'll go ahead and beautify this just a little bit makes a little bit easier to discuss in trees especially for not fighting your editor forward to finding here is a local set you the difference is we you have to be a little more implicit I think it's you can be if you more explicit about defining a said you can be implicit but it's is the cleaner syntax to go this because you don't have to think about the contents as much in my opinion you can do it otherwise we're going to execute this example you could find what does the things that define a local variable s that is a set of ports add initialize it contents of Four Points should be so on and then there's this for entries you can be this is the explicit way to find one we can actually say set equals set the porch then you begin in the 20 cp23 tcpa TCP and 443 TCP this is a second way to do it This Is War The Constructor if you will wear this will Val set last one that we've created equal to a set of ports that is implicitly determined based on the contents of that set Broncos are ports of sudden counts face when they say take out the TCP the reason I'm using something a little bit new this is a very standard thing you'll see please set this account second be any fundamental typing bro extended type if you're creating your own person like that II set of colors as shown in the am in example he noticed to be red blue pink and purple fine no other two notations I could I took out the TCP and that's the only difference between S&S one the fundamental types of this is now a set of counts for sports we could easily do the same thing here just to make sure we're comparing and contrasting the same we go except we have to set this equal to count it is a set of counts supports I won't work otherwise run that the Run fine no errors set up accounts when which were in being explicit about what it is and we are also explicitly initializing it immediately upon creation S1 is a set being struck being put together by a Constructor the set Constructor that contains the counts 20123 80 and 443 these are actually syntactically different functionally the same so that you will have to decide which way you prefer another way we can do this just so you're completely from ways you can do things in bro scripts will give her the second example so we're going to go ahead and create a set that is the contains counts canes integers but we're not going initialise it we're not going to put anything in it bro knows what it is it's Define we use the ad operator with the set as an argument bracket and then we can add what we want in there and now we run obviously this lot more code to write out it's a little it's little it's not as obvious in my opinion The Witcher nationalizing to I if you are initializing a sad and you always going to have a set start out with values that you care about BB explicit about return this wising it to instead of equal to 21 2384 3 just go ahead and get on with it I would only use the ad notation is if you're collecting things up as you're executing in an event handler are in a function what time you really want to add to a set in that capacity do you end up with a lot of extra Konya to maintain again to find Those ads where they are where you put them in your code and it just it doesn't make sense again unless you're collecting things up as you're executing I would not use this the syntax here for an initialization if you want initialise use use initialized initialized initialized when he created it's quicker it's faster to cleaner and it's definitely easier to reference later than having to potentially go dig up plus you know if you if you had a couple lines you might get sloppy and one extra curly brakes you might actually drink some other code we can take out future operator air engineering error it's always I even if you're not you're talking a minute here minute there a minute here in the dare you could put portrait some other use because of this difference you might see this till you might see you some other bro script otherwise created this way and that's fine I just for me and my sister bro and I think money other people's uses your bro script the less you as a reference but you have to read it's always better we all have a million things going on and less is always more in that case condition of this we will go ahead and delete you want to delete something out of your set do that is there's an operator I delete operator takes the set and then what you want to remove delegates to the the add operator and will execute and it's gone that's simple those are sets and bro and how to manipulate it by using how to define them you seen the various in taxes in which you can Define them and it's it's up to you I've given you some hints on what I would consider to be the preferred way to do things play for me but this is kind of how it goes over all you'll see it defined either way and could you looked at and hopefully that makes sense and gives you an idea of the best way moving forward in the way should design your scripts
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/regular.org:1: Regular expressions in bro just a quick overview of registrations and brown will go up will deal with him a bit more later a large they are similar to other regular Expressions I just want to go you obviously can't read what's here concepts are created by enclosing text with an stop / blah / that's your regular expression that's your pattern which is the built-in type representing a regular expression and bra the biggest thing to note is actually the Asterix this up there syntax supported by regular expressions and bro patterns and bro is a flex lexical analyzer at the bottom slacks makes up an inordinate amount of bro on the back end compile time it's an amazing tool and it is the lifeblood of parsing engine internal bra if natural music for regular expressions the parent support two types of matching exact and in bed read through the flex documentation kind of absorbent and you will you will you understand me very quickly any familiarity are ready with me I even grew up obviously you're sad and you'll become familiar with patterns and bro very quickly exact matches with double equals you have the carrot which is beginning of line in the dollar sign into line anchors so just be aware that that's exact matching that's just a I just want to skim over this I want everyone to have it back there mine that is there where you'll run into it and bro will be depending on what you're doing if you're trying to do specific matches let's stay on a user agent in ACP possibly a good idea to use a pattern there depending or family of should say are there they are used and what row cause BPD which is the packet inspection engine on the back end for testing at patterns and in starting a protocol analyzers so you don't want to do in there you'll see him there if you look for. Sig within bro user local bro or where you're based reference bro is you'll be able to see those patterns and expressions that's the mean the major thing you'll see him used in a bra there they are there available we will discuss where might be some lab and some uses job them moving forward that's one you will see regular expressions in bro
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/http-sum.org:2: this'll be the answer the lab for implementing a sunsets framework bro script determines the total of methods using HP flows in a sample pcap get vs. post setter from the outside I am going to say unequivocally that summary statistics in bro are absolutely brutally non-trivial the answer to this which comes from heart hot a little bit of struggles with it and otherwise difficulties with General now with that said the weather radar Pro Shop stats before I get it Ashley stop in this lab if I have it already. This enough is Define those sample bits and tidbits and information and scripts that you can start from the hardest thing you can do in in programming a general is start with a blank canvas the hardest thing you could ever do and thankfully the need to do that is almost zero is at 0 + with some stats starting there is very much an uphill battle and one that I don't advise anyone really to do unless you want to you want to go fine by me but don't unless you absolutely really really really are determined to otherwise so if you started with it you're in good company I would be remiss to say that I haven't struggled with some stats having used it quite a bit it's a it's a it's a steep learning curve it's extremely powerful extremely useful but the learning curve is extremely steep honestly is a subject with him bro script itself that we could probably spend going through a lot of examples of going through a lot of detail especially with diving implementation no optimization points here and there and everywhere that that are possible we could probably spend a solid week just looking at the summary statistics framework and exercising and teasing out examples and going through things and I don't think I'm best exaggeration of of the reality of the power of this framework and the complexity unfortunately one big S the other at times and it's is very true that it is it is very powerful which means it is also rather difficult to learn at times a lot of information crammed into a what is really relatively elegantly small framework For Better or Worse that's what you have but mobileserve hopefully is something moving forward that you can lean on and the some stats and otherwise it will at least give you a look at some stats again that's that's fine at least I give you an appreciation of what is possible if you do ever want to revisit it hand it off to somebody else to deal with either or obviously what you see here is his number one in them the exercises just copy and paste that the framework that existed as the template into Triborough or otherwise it in other than you can use soccer or otherwise to execute them in command line there's a lot of ellipses in here there's a lot of details not filled in for obvious reasons the point mystic force you to dive through documentation to read it I get an idea of the robustness of it obviously I am just for many things are somewhat random just to make him or takes a little less screen real estate for the demonstrations obviously too which is never bad but not absolutely necessary lots of years of looking at code and brain personally reads things efficiently in certain ways not awesome I wish I were the second part pick the appropriate calculation to use to some stats reducer if you look the document you think looking if we want to find the total number methods for an HP flow of those messages go get vs. post versus what will probably going to wind up using his top k in top number of thanks so we just infect leak leave off the top and we're worried about nothing else so that gives us a starting point producer sometimes producer we can start filling in some the stream will be dot method you can name it otherwise but this is nice and straightforward no ambiguity we know exactly what we're looking at and yes be very careful these are Unicode ellipsis if you don't remember I will have a problem I just doesn't FYI you want reply set of some stats okay for the top size of 50 it's a bit as we get through it and you may tell her that also obviously if you got the answer you may have already if you haven't feel free to go in and tweak this again use this as a template uses as an example of something you know does one thing can you massage it into doing another for your purposes somewhere else and that's them fundamental approach you can use here so we got the receipt template portions here so we can go to create a named some stats of hu underscored method of 12 hours producers of the set of all that is what is to find here and a buck was also another with every 12 hours it'll fire this event doing this and try bro fire it artificially we talk obviously based on the the the replay that pcap and not an actual wall clock time fortunately and that's something else to keep in mind as you go through some stats Scripps Deepak if you're going to fire it make sure you have some bro some Peak apps that you can use against it so you don't have to wait to see if your is your approaches succeed or fail engendered update up some something available other than live network data in order to test your hypothesis otherwise it's a slow agonizing process it's already not trivial don't exacerbate the problem by not having test date available is really the bottom line I think that's if not been stated elegantly it's been hammered home throughout the course try to do things statically before you ever do the dynamically always be capped before live Network traffic always there are instances where you absolutely cannot that's appreciated where you can it's really comes down to being that simple so for the rest here so we have the Prototype filled in the results are going to the results of the stream hdb. Method stream so that's what we're going to actually run through that's what we're collecting that's what we're worried about this is this is not a lab this is not an easy thing to do this is something if you Google it and you find an answer for us on the clothes great and you got the lab done great frankly you answer the lab if it works the way it's supposed to you did it it doesn't look exactly like Road Great Sharon example I'd love to see it might be many times more efficient and that's great I would really like to see that and I'm sure share with everyone else Lovelace let's all get a little bit better at this it sucks same battles of protecting our Network so let's see if we can do it together as best we can create a local Vector of observations this is again where there's not a better way to put it then it's you have to do too few times you have to fall on your face if you times and you have to see these scripts after a while to understand what you're looking at the work comes down to have some examples and that's the goal here if nothing else you as a palpable working example that you built up what we're going through and doing is we're going to fight results of issue method have been collected up over time this is mapreduce for fillers mapreduce that's what some stats is and you run obviously method over top of that pull at your data sifted sort it and deal with it accordingly we're going to do is we are going to create a vector of these observations again allows us to have duplicates versus asset which is D dupes everything advantageous when you're looking at statistics in this capacity and I'm going to grab the top of the top cake get tops over and grab the top bits out of the results which we were already said was top K that's the set we're building up and we're at the top 10 we're going to pull those out of the 50 that were collecting up we're not going to really we're going to run through this this vegetable putting together we're going to print them Cruiser not the heavy lifting is under the hood here it runs through the collected data that we're collecting up here in the reducer it's putting it into a vector that week and then do a for Loop over and manipulate in this case we're just going to print them we're not trying to do anything too crazy here suicide print format method equals percent ass and then will print out the actual thought so as of Eye of string again I know it's a string because that's what the observations are there is so many there's only certain observations you can pull out and it's a string after I have to look at the the records you have to dig through them there's a lot of details here that we kind of Breeze through a bit and the overs overview section of the summary statistics and you have to get in the meat of it to really start understand where those work the goal here is to let you know to make some Headway to read technician income and to come up with a solution that may work or may not but you'll learn from this example scrub you to take what I'm showing you here take it back and then reread the problem and then executed that's the beauty of a lab like this it's not it it's not meant to be anyone down it's meant to actually show you something that is hard and let you even use it later for your edification it is not true this is not trivial to say the first time I went through Neal building and stop and think about this until he wasn't doing it and what have you with regard to summary statistics. I did right would be laughably long wrong go with it it's okay I don't don't like I said you're anybody who didn't get this magically is and great company as far as I'm concerned clothes that out should be all we want going to print a little extra here pretty that closes that out now what are the things I wanted you to observe what is a couple things first the creation of this the some stat honestly brutally simple wow that's that's crazy that's actually it is it's deceptively simple and as you implemented is brutally difficult is the Elegance again of this framework hopefully I'm doing a good job of you want the power these it is really cool as so many things you can do with it but I also don't want you two to be overwhelmed by the frustration of it because of the power behind it and a lot of things coming together it is not trivial another big thing observe and learn is okay we've created this wonderful having a very simple method here we don't have any observations we have no means of getting data in there so let's just let's just for grins execute this Cy Firex buddy exercise traffic because of the Simplicity of it course there's a bug sutech Saturn your ass bumps that right there , I do recommend going through an embassy firing these things a times just to make sure that nothing is broken course we hit we don't think we're trying to print but this method as there are no observations some stats are Kings of observations sure where I should try to pull out here recruiting the Specter of summary some stats observations that weird in populating using this method and one thing note is it executed fine which is great and his clean that means everything else here is good with Ronnie issues their lease of code execution we don't know if implemented it right but at least nothing's going to crash and that's in and of itself a wonderful thing but reservations otherwise we'll never know it works or not type the stats part of some stats I can't tell you how many times don't worry again and good company would you add an observation you're adding it to the stream so you have to make sure that this stream this string here is the stream it must match your reducer stream if that's what you're after mind you these have to all be correlated and in this case the epoch results when it fires were to finding this event the results Must ALL match so these almost light up if that's what you're looking at if you're collecting up a bunch of different statistics creating a bunch of these different method name of these different things going through maybe you're creating it tons of Statistics just realize you have to map those altogether to be cognizant of that be aware I honestly will have to say I do not recommend putting a ton of some stats single text file into a single file just for some save yourself the headache of trying to keep track of things break it down have a you know a nice director with an underscore underscore load underscore underscore. Profile and load those up individually to be a hero in and jam everything into a single file you're only going to run yourself ragged debugging because you're going to debug I promise so do you have is the string which is the method that were after and that is from a sphere Cuesta Methodist here and that correlates with the string here so there are some correlations there we know how zirbel's do we have the right observables I don't know let's go to run the script and see we may exploded may work flawlessly it worked so number of get methods we have any exercise traffic Peak Cavern 252 then proposed in 97 and never of head methods are 10 fairly reasonable given the will run against HP cool is one get and if we actually look at the HDPE flow we see a single get so that's that's a little more than coincidence problem you can do the same thing or SMTP could do the same thing over any protocol if you want to dig out any kind of Statistics along these lines again this is a deceptively simple script for being your 22 lines or so complex and this is the answer to the problem very straightforward anyone else sold it otherwise it would be great to see it great to hear about it Siri questions and concerns is it going to say that I've gone through some research who's framework is complex as you can see the Elegance of oven is seen with the what am I sleeping over finite scripture verse small script here and what it is able to do go through and collect at those statistics and print them for you and show you what they are now the whole printing obviously just to run it one more time again pointless unless you doing this static analysis if you are not doing static analysis you need to admit those statistics in a log they could be consumed down range why you end up just putting stuff to standard out and that is up in the standard out log and by and large that is going to be fairly unhelpful for you lizard lizard Mama see others other sections side things to keep aware of a bit of review from from those other sections but something today again to be aware of I think some stats is a brilliant thing to use against a bunch of pcaps she can collect up the statistics take him back using otherwise over longer-term flows Reebok because this day has been collected in memory depending on what you're collecting you're consuming memory you're going to see memory anyway depending on what you're collecting depends on the amount of the actual volume of memory that you are using be careful there why is that is the answer to the sunsets framework
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/http-large-flow.org:2: Notice around a large HEB flow event ground up script I gave us I think so how will see if you got through this weather that's true or not the whole notion of what this is trying to do is ground-up of you need to look for a CP I gave him so what you do look for in H-E-B needs to be able to check to make sure those just within those records are you made it up running into problems you need to understand what connection State remove dolls as an event so now I guess to a new connection so now I guess you know if you want to say new connection in case they remove analogous to Growing it in bro dumb very straightforward that's all they are and then be able to find all the necessary things for a notice to be able to have it be usable and otherwise fire appropriate well further Ado let's going to find out if the event the singular of it and here we are worried about but one second before we do that will go ahead and Define the muscle first will call this module how to cheat in your welcome to do this and if you didn't do this that's absolutely fine and I'm honestly going to explicitly just load the base Frameworks notice and mostly out of habit just because that's how I've been doing that works long that's what I'll do does using AC be if you're staying that used to be mods existing module via the module you gained all the access to the variables in that module we don't necessarily have to do that I'm just going to do it that way so when the notice fires and this is something to keep note up and then notice fires whatever type you extend it'll be HTTP colon colon blah if that's the notice type that you if you want to do it based on your corporation name based on your group name based on something like that for the module and then it kind of extend from there that's not a bad idea actually it's an excellent idea if you were to do it that way I'd be a great standardization method otherwise if you and do it onesie twosie for specific purposes that's also fine the bottom line here is there's no correct answer the correct answers what works for you anybody tells you tell you otherwise because they now I did say to go ahead and add that event so I'll follow my own directions connection State remove C connection we're going to fill in here in a bit thank you for that second is Define an Xbox way to find the module I went into that first S4 block and then will close the export block again I cannot really stayed in fact Lee enough why you want to go and do that even if you're like a family thing and it's not a bad idea going to do it Define value to use as the trigger for a large the next bit here I give you the record fields that you need to look for the response body length in the request body length if you want head and looked up in the documentation for the HP record the affair record with an HEB actually that's a great idea to go and do in general there is an absolutely enormous amount of information in that record in that info record that is there that's the nature hdb in the right bro handles it but it's it's really more the way it should be worse don't be familiar with it but don't lose too much sleep over memorizing any of it just know where to find it know how to understand it and hopefully by now you understand the fundamental types and effectively what's going on there to be able to sit to sort through what you're worried about what really matters and be able to use it effectively you're at that point not this will open your eyes a little bit more so we'll do I declare the word definable value here in a Riddell football value constant yeah that'll be a constant it will go and say was called bad length it was set equal to just say 10,000 what that $10,000 will soon to be bites because that's the one area that bro does not have a specific being into the main specific language it doesn't have an ocean of write a gigabyte terabyte and so on and so forth and that's okay greatest shortcomings we're all doing just fine clearly so we'll set it to 10,000 that seems like a fairly reasonable initial triggered it kind of weed through what's going on here and your actual environment you'll probably have a defined value that will cause you some kind of concerned anyway usually it's a few megabytes something along those something there is really what you're worried about where you're going to lose out eventually in his using at the beach GT people low and slow type of tax you really don't see those vht be too often if at all that's where you just have to kind of thing through it and then the next vote for here the item for defied all the required values for a notice in an export Blackwell as I've already said we have to do the real for the notice time the word anchor add into that I will just give it something original like large it's beef if you notice is we've gone through my my propensity to capitalize change capitalization standby sing for me no right or wrong whether you make this all caps all lowercase if you camelcase him whatever you're comfortable with whatever your standardization is is the right answer I have a tendency to make things kind of section capitalization appropriate the best I can you want to do is is perfectly long as you and your organization when you're developing things like this have reached consensus and everybody can be as best as humanly possible read and understand everybody else's code and the artifacts that are generated can be consumed down range that's all that matters keep that in mind always as you go through anything like this so 4 section 4 that's everything we need that's a notice that that's the part of the really the Simplicity of you have to carry with a notice you just have to extend that tights Smyrna do that and everything else just falls out it's a function call think of it as nothing more complex than that filling in a record in immediate fashion when they're calling their function that's it is it it still looks different it still looks different but that's all it is and now we're to use the user definable Value Plus the notice within the connection State remove event to generate notices when required and then check and we're going to check that he should be record exists is populated within the connection record other words this is where are you now with this far into the course there's some expectation of kind of trial-and-error here some Google searching obviously I can't prevent that and I wouldn't prevent that that's not reality when which we live in now that you you have access to go you have stackoverflow you have GitHub use them but you always have to use them with the caveat that you might be downloading maybe accessing maybe using somebody else's bad code and if you so choose to do that that's fine you mind Learning Farm or doing that from scratch good thing I'll be at but not a bad thing it's something I can can't I would stop you from doing if I could so the the hit in V bomb item there is we want to check the DHCP record exists within the connection that is populated that it is something the reason being is connection State remove is fired a lot we have no means of saying hey we are we are looking for H-E-B connections being removed only when we call connection is removed it is a event handler going in the event handler Q with all the other connection State removes it did not special other than what it is populated with so we have to explicitly within the body of connection State remove check to see if we are looking what we're looking for are we looking for this to be a we're going to be late should be able to deal with FTP SMTP none of the above now this is where my hole popping on look early in check early return early check off and return off and you know just as soon as you come in the singular thing that will void the rest of that event handler needing to fire is the absolute first thing you need to check for if it's not their return in this case this is an effective return so if it's not hcp we're going to kick back out just because we're going to I'm going to do this 7 minutes body this with that that check Suburban Estates and we're going to say return and that way if it's not ACV record is not been sold return immediately the rest doesn't matter otherwise we are going to look to see if do you use the example nose from before I I think that's a pretty good structure if you're looking at both the origination ocean the destination I was to see if there's an odd flow of events there's nothing wrong with that approach and I think it's actually a very a good template for moving forward so we can use the set really generate this sent again on the flying here to my own rule of closing things out before I start the next block so we're going to Loop to repeat this house or Loop through those two those two values the origination of the responses we're going to say if see CP we're going to check to make sure it exists first body length so if it doesn't exist for me lean all avoiding out of here that's it it's it it's not there the rest does not matter this is a neat Nuance at bro used to very quickly links request body length is greater than greater than equal to the bad length large depending on which concerned with if you want to trip right at the bad length or just over so you don't want it you know plus one or a right at there's no right or wrong it's whatever you're trying to achieve here I'm going to say greater than or equal to 10,000 there's no right or wrong for this approach it's just depends on your internal criteria if you want to implement something like this in the reality and in your ear actually really work I want to say large HP flow and we'll see message was for Matt let's see here what I say percent a switch will say the hosts were in front of the house and we're going to say whether or not it's local or remote 2% s that will be the client of the server this is the natural way in which you actually build up notices overtime as you just kind of you find out you find a rhythm with them and this is how you parse them down range had a request body length 5% d and now what is fill in the details host site is local Adder on that host true cool and if it's false it's remote and we'll say is host equal to C First Nation host the client else client else is a server we will add in the crust body length as a set and that will take care of what the notice will contain it will say connection is that and that takes care of looking at the request body iForce feeling so Brazen which I think is we can actually copy and paste this and we're going to look at the response body length set a request it's for check your response this is part of the reason I wanted to do this if you don't change both you're going to end up crashing bro at some point did not necessarily nhb no sir for this reason but it another area be very careful of how you approach things I'm just going to fire and run it against traffic pcap there's a there's a ton of ACP traffic in there I think there's one over 1100 connections so willed will trip and fall over one or two that I'm sure and more than one or two more than one or two so the local to the server have a response body of 16762 that proves out the script is working not worried about directionality here so if you're looking at internal versus external your want to change up your script the note if you want to have it be specific to your organization you maybe your company name that's a great idea to do something along those lines it just it just depends on your operating environment again how you're fighting is no decision whether to being used downrange and how they're being used on Range you need to make decisions I I can I can sit here and make suggestions all day have to agree internally in your stand requirements in what works best for you and go from there the right or wrong is whether it works and if it works you're right and he was a rather large one so we can just for just for grins there's no right or wrong again to the stress holding we can set it to 250 thousand and I'm guessing the number of actual notices will get here will be cut a lot while does he still get one we saw the one looks like it too 13 and then see it's due next is the analog of that I should I stand corrected it is not actually I do apologize yes it is yes it is so that's what you expect to get at 7 both into connection and that's that's fine can do is if you're only worried about client-side you can set it turn on IP space and you can filter it a little bit more and it kind of go from there so it origination host instead of the responses which we could actually just take out that side of things just take out the responses here it's really a singular set so obviously the codes a little bit silly that for Loop Riley actually ends up nothing just the one side of the connection as you would expect private Network IP address space and it's going out to a destination so that would definitely local decline is wrong it really should be server so you have to go in and massaging sweet things a little bit but that is the full script and how you would ride it
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/hook.org:3: Hooks in bra what is a another flavor function their summer events and they can also have multiple bodies have their different into regards and just before we get into those hooks are also something that are missing to use in Miss Miss use depending so be very careful understand these differences very careful and they do execute immediately when it involves so these are not Advance they absolutely fire melee Taylor terminate further handlers get executed so if you have hook test one hook Test 1 Test 1 and they're all linked by a priority then depending on where you break oh so you break in hooked S1 II with a priority of 20 the first month 1033 break in that middle one that means the last one will not fire where that at the end of the body or return statement is reached the next hook Handler will be executed so if you return or execution ends and then hook the next hook Goes Forth a hook Handler body that terminates with a break statement No remaining hook hangers will execute you can kind of think of this is the way bro executes is it and by the prioritize them it actually concatenate some together so hook one no one priority 30 is the top priority one priority 20 is the middle hook priority hook one priority 10 is the bottom defect Lee Sandwiches in the gather the way Pro deals with it is it kind of nullifies that return and it goes eyes and executes the only exception is if there's a break bro handles that is where of that break is in any of those handlers than that's what does not execute that's the biggest thing yours is the break is what will disallow further hook execution of that type anything else like what a return does or the end of a call and a hook body is happening if only thing you remember from this is the fact that a break means no more execution of hooks of that type remember that and everything else is actually just gravy the way you use can you use hooks hooks are useful to provide customisation points for modules as they allowed you to announce her decision to cite specific code so this is effectively The Next Step Above and Beyond using a reed death actually execute code to make decisions you can actually execute code to be able to say do you want to continue on you then you can fire a break or not return value of a hook is an implicit bull you don't have to Define it it's just assumed to be that went so the value of T remaining that all handlers for the hook or executed f means that only some of the handlers may have executed do the one hitter body exiting as a result of a break statement if around a hook all executed in that if will then expand if your chicken for True you'll actually go into the body of that if and if you're not it will go around it or if you're checking for not true so you checking for Falls then the then that if body will execute just depends on what you're looking for depends on whether that return is even necessary a lot of times you'll firehook and it'll be for kind of a side effect reasons and you won't care otherwise maybe those hooks are they going to do a read f or something odd calculation out of rehab but doing to do a calculation that then you are going to use otherwise somehow so be aware of that so usage they got to lose it already there good as an extraction Point obstruction point for execution decisions they going to miss an extended redef this is a readout that allows you to execute code so you can yes you do some kind of computation versus singular on off switch way and they make a lot more sense they are very powerful but when misused they actually can be a very powerful way to cause frustration and confusion instead of actually allow you to get work done more quickly and they may be used to alter the personality of the sensor execution so as I said it is an expansion on the readout approach to the small versus large sensor configuration and approaching is you can do can you do calculations instead of just singular on-off switches that is very very very cool it also lets you as I said kind of the personality we can load up and it'll actually do a hook in from that hook and look and say okay this hook at your the code is xq in the bus trips loading up that's what this Hook is for a smaller sensor and that set certain values does certain things maybe you're setting the same file name so you can actually have the same load statements and everything but the contents of that are different based on that personality and it's going to be a larger sensor is going to set values differently larger values adjust things do some kind of calculation and call it a function otherwise black without being a singular on-off switch it doesn't based on as they say kind of a personality script that you have this Global that loads this Hook is global that load in your local bro the same then loads these personality scripts or singular scripts you can salmon be the same name and then the contents of them can change you have to change how you load it you don't have to go in and just really how you deploy this is the strength here is it's deployment you're copying something different than actually going in editing a file or using puppet or something along those lines to change something really handy when you're doing meal you can kind of Upstream to a makefile approach to this what makes a tiny sensor rolls up the right things that you care about Valley that smaller sensor you know make make large sensor will do the inverse of that roll up the big configuration files necessary and them big hook files capable of doing what you need to do an electric sensor that way it makes a little more sense and you understand the power of this you know so understand the confusion if you're not very careful and you really need to test things out assumptions and hooks are what a really bite you and I implore you to if you remember nothing of what I said in here other than the fact that I hook it can be an extended read if that allows computational code execution the fact that a break will break the chain of hooks being executed of the same type remember those two things and everything else is just bonus any good reference to look up everything else those with those of the two points especially the second one about the break statement they will save you time and a lot of hopefully relieve a lot of potential frustration the decoration Hook is very simple simple decoration hook and then the argument an argument is possibly empty and it writes a comma separated values they are declaring for Global usage so you can it's very it looks very similar to how you would declare a global events or Global function Global name you're giving it the differences it's a hook inside of a function or event and then the arguments where is an implicit Boolean return type so as your executor of all hooks executor returns true that means all hooks executed if it returns false that means one of them what could be one or more of the hooks did not execute you don't know bro does not provided that information back I would say in most circumstances that you will never need to know that because you can tell by the side effects of those hooks anyway what did it did not get executed don't worry about that too much just know the the implicit true true or false is a Boolean true is all hooks executed and false means not all of them executed executed they 2
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/hook.org:5: speed demonstration how to use Hooks and bro and give you an idea of what they look like they're usages it's one of those things that your best it's best you test them it's best you looking existing examples what I'm trying to do here is to show you some of the Oddities to him at the further Hammer home the break-in return break being the big one you have priority especially effect especially in light of usage of break too crazy here very straightforward this example was taken straight from org end up something in prayer I would have been done something very very familiar it's not identical but it said we went ahead and just borrow that was there was phantom pain and show you more of it I'll go ahead and go over it then I'll run it it's an event it's only been handling here is borrowing it very typical going to execute the hook my hook pass string High based on priority but look we priority of Tim 8 sing a hook or a event without a priority is a soon-to-be priority 0 so effectively right in the middle then one would -5 so that should be the one that will execute last in light of what we have on turtledove 10025 you passing high that should pass all the way through unless you're otherwise redefining it I hook should be the first priority hook should be Naruto funny s equals by remember the interesting thing about hooks can kind of take out the curly brace in the next definition of the hook and kind of weldy's altogether where it gets fuzzy is you have a brakes or brake over turn out of there next function in Theory read this right call it it will be executed with as equals by the string should say break out of my hook handling should print by the end there's a break and if there wasn't that break we need to figure out if this and execute it shouldn't based on everything we read in the toilet right so was that let's go ahead and run the other thing to keep track of call hooks execute implicit return of true the hooks above here would have executed so the bullion Rhett would be set I'm going to test that and then print all handlers ran if not that will obviously not be executed let's go to run it and see what the results are says priority 10 Mi hook Handler High we passed it high and that's as it expected now we passed in by or we didn't pass it we actually set the value s by which again these get concatenated it's a little bit strange but normally you think well I'd have to call that function again but it's implicit bro we'll just go ahead and effectively take a look at those bodies and kind of weld them together internal how to execute them break out of my hook handling by is what executes and the brakes we never get to this not going to happen is correct we'd never execute well we can obviously fix that that out and what do you think we get two things to change should get the not going to happen with bye handlers ran because the my hand look my hook returns true nothing that I have not talked about is you have to be explicit in saying you're calling a hooks are the same instead of calling a function you can just call the function and bro to fire hook you to say hook and then the name of the hook in an any possible arguments do you have to be very explicit and that's that comes to the fact that not exist so let's show them this is this is the reason why we're going to come in all these out we're going to run it Pro doesn't give an error because it knows that that hook Handler my hook does not exist that's a big thing to be aware of you don't have to actually implement the hook Handler you cannot implement the hook Handler and by not implementing it is also actually a value in bro that means that it did not execute and that's something to be aware of the value of return true in all handlers ran which in this case is wrong they didn't exist so that the hook handlers didn't fire but the default value of the bullying is true so the prince that so be aware of that that's a major caveat that if you're doing any kind of value didn't exist so unless you just you're designing around that possibility you're going to have some interesting things happen that you could have to make sure things happen you have to fire up the script debugger and and kind of set a breakpoint there and figure out what in the world's going on and that's a that's a good reason to do it we go up here and modify this another break return here the return is supposed to act the same as the end of code execution as we've talked so we should schedule them all effectively this this return the way bro welds things together as I keep describing them these all became effectively one statement that return becomes a no up and effectively just goes away return and it's it's a special case function or you can see the Special K event handler that it bro knows it because it's hook that return really doesn't mean anything different than a the end of execution of that hook Handler it again and no opposite effect they just takes it out of coat that execution you don't worry about it here to make this just a little more interesting set s equal to final statement and I'm here definitely definitely right and we should get high by and final statement highest priority highest price 10 and we said bye out of my hook handling and then here after it says it does not break we set s again equal to final statement and said we should say that makes more sense heino in front of statement in all hook handlers ran so that gives you an idea of hooks you can wrap through the Bro scripts that ship with bro to see some of the hooks capabilities in there there are file extraction Frameworks that exist out there if you look on GitHub you'll see a couple file extraction Frameworks in which it loads up is a kind of describe a different personalities you can give your sensor in this case the subset of capability of a bro and that's the power structural framework you're on Ellen say I'm a very late in Microsoft network and your your modern things and you want to only extract office artifacts so you're going to work look specifically for mine types that correspond to office documents in word excel PowerPoint and you just want to extract those nothing else on that never you you're worried about maybe they said it's late and Sound by the SMB Network and that's all you're worried about play find that's one of those examples of the personality types prescription frame archi build out using his hook capability Spanaway weather capable of as opposed to just doing the on off switch of Redux that's not to take anything clearly away from readouts powerful you could even run wrap your hook loading with a readout for some reason though as we've done straighten will show one more time we coming out all the hook handlers here gluten-free run this example do you want are out because those is a function doesn't exist but is not a function it it goes had an executes and instead of just returns and says hey you know everything returned true everything ran fine because of the Fall below values a true and we're good oh that's that's the game I want to hammer that home in a little bit to keep that in mind that if you're not instantiating hook Handler if you're testing for it there is that that's it really it should be a kind of a Tri-State type capability where are in umm of some kind where it returns back no handlers Ram all Handler successfully ran or none ran the way roll currently works it is a caveat that could get you a little bit
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/funcation.org:2: function declarations and bro we have obviously seen these for a while going to go through in one off examples and in demos now we're getting the formalities everything ocean decorations they follow names same namespace rules as variables no local namespace Anonymous functions which Orlando's in Python Landers and many other languages so no local namespace no Anonymous functions just keep that keep that in mind you're going to want to write code to that because it's not it's not going to work in the bra and it has a product for this is a prototype of formally exporting as a global of function so this is an export block as soon as an extra bottle with a global this is the way it looks now pays very special attention this is Austin Texas's I'm going to expand on this low before I describe it just because I want you to really pay special attention here this Syntax for exporting the function prototype is different than the Declaration of the function that actually filling out the function y because mainly because it's it's simplified for going through why's it was a design Choice it is the languages that stands be aware of it it is not as obvious as you would see in C or C plus plus normal saline go or any other language it's it's a little more but this is the most work with so glad this is an export what time you really would use this prototype format like this is if you are exporting it otherwise be using the function from within your module you just declare the function and get on with using it only time this matters is if you're exporting it that's the other caveat you never explored a function for executioner usage otherwise will matter but so we declare Global we name it then we gave it to arguments there is actually a opening princi here and this is a, separated list with a prince he hear the return is optional you only put a return if you need it but it must end with a semicolon or you'll end up with errors it is like this party again it simplifies at why is it simplify because this syntax is the same as declaring a variable that's why what makes it different what makes it special is instead of type you have to formally declare it to be a can hear that's the differentiator and that's what makes this a little bit different but it was its Simplicity of the analyzer of the language line up why do you care about that don't buy a large but at least gives you an understanding of why things look somewhere in helps you associate why a functional traded in remember the syntax versus having to look it up every time look at her house so I promise I do but cemented in your mind why it looks like it does it just it cannot infer that a function is a function versus anything else the difference between explicit and then it goes I said returns are optional already discussed that the returns are optional function of the problem without a prototype may still be accessible when it's definition is loaded I have to export it it will just go in that Global namespaces we've already talked about if you don't exported it will be there to be used otherwise the definition example so we've we've shown you before what's the if we were to if you exporting us but this is the actual function prototype it looks very similar to golang quite honestly the semicolon at the end of the bottle by sure if you used to moving between go and golang another language is this it in bro script the semicolon can you switch back the other you will make that are be aware of it I say that with again a smile on my face after doing that more than I care to remember be aware since the function sample that takes a single argument is string s and returns a Bull a bully Clara local rat the return equal to true principal function and return true turn right which is true very simple very academic crazy going on here just more of a shell of how things work that is in a nutshell function declarations and bro they are very straightforward my large you will use them decent bit be a little bit the caveat here is be a little bit careful with row over and over using functions I know that's going to sound weird I'm a huge proponent of using you know if you going to ride it more than once use a function but be careful and bro for an optimization if you over use cilia function that's within functions nephew was in the functions you start to actually lose some performance and that's because of the way bro internally has to build up the various tax and references and affectionately wind-up large stacks of cplusplus objects in order to execute those various function blocks and return things back around and deal with them careful Again by a large I am a big fan of functions I use them a lot in every other language your bro I have to kind of stop take a step back and think about a little bit is it worth the possible hit of performance it depends on robust emotion is Shelly saying if you're going to really experience performance hit if it is doing a lot of heavy lifting or you're doing lots of nested function calls you're going to want to unwind those nested function calls because that's tax basis going to get a little bit crazy with that the way bro does things and turn them are doing that for pcap analysis that's again a different story then if you're doing live network data you always see want to save as many cycles you can for Life network data to squeeze out every bit of performance you can out of a sensor on a peek at it's not that you wanted your throwing away Cycles but by and large it's going to run faster you're going to have things return back quicker you're not going to have your network data is live Network date is effectively an infinite tap obviously keycaps are finite even large pcap are finite unless you're keeping massive tables in memory or things like that dear exhaust memory doing that if he cap is not going to be ever worse than life Network traffic it's also more predictable you can figure out your bounds on a pcap live Network traffic unless you have something Upstream shaping your data being sent down you don't know you absolutely cannot know but that's the caveat be careful of massively nested functions shallower the better wear appropriate even at the cost of having a copy and paste in duplicate sand code of his very finite fundamental code that's fine you it's annoying but do it it's well worth it for you function declarations in bro these will look like Goliath experience they will not look like too much else in Python exactly why is our standard best friend forever Define a function C function Prince and now we're not going to take it so we're going to close for immediately I like to format it where I put the curly brace open curly brace to Claire the statement in the function standard your standard maybe to put it on the same line you want to do but standard that's my only suggestion wasn't I always like doing any clear function or an event is go ahead and close the function and go through everything have it may be absolutely perfect you need to teach me how you got for the first time but you don't want to do that and send me forget to close the function and still that's that kind of skates so I always close it tonight's Habit to get into and within our event ruin it we're going to just call Prince hey we have to always put in parentheses there's not a there's not a notation that if it doesn't take arguments you can just say semicolon in the statement I don't know what to do now you have to actually say well but it's a function so you actually have to give it prizzi's open and close we should get nothing nothing sitting here so that's that's an example of a very simple function the function of Prince and it's going to take an argument a count so classic parameter and the subtypes so it's variable your wine didn't Claire for the perimeter colinde in the tight we're going to take a string s string and we'll go ahead and fill it in so for this let's just pray nothing crazy Sprint we are going to want to call it number in the first argument is type count 34 2nd minimize number of arguments you don't want 25 arguments spanning three lines if you're doing that probably not going to do that and then ever-popular so we would assume you'll get a will get one two three four, the commas implicit the print will not will actually add to come between them I will get the string test nothing crazy there for now function take any arguments there is a function that takes arguments one or one or more arguments the functions that actually will return something so the format for that is function stuff so let's take what's a swan strain strain ever going to return a string that looks very deep how you declare that is very similar to how you declare a parameter for the function the function definition so open the function close the function and now it's still in the function we're going to actually say return stuff so there's no return operator we're going to see return there is string concatenation S1 Plus or add a space and so what we should see a space LS1 add with space - - - 3 - is space and then S2 semi colon and is returning back a string that's the type is returned there's not a print so unless we do something with the data coming back on the floor by the bro he doesn't care about it The Voice just to demonstrate that was safe return stuff that's not going to say first argument so we know explicit we know it takes two arguments because this past one which is a type string and S2 which is a type of string the first argument, second argument Sandra separator letsrun we just we did the nice little string concatenation in the function what we can do with that a local try stuff and will print temp what are the first argument read ashes now we declare a local variable here how to do that why don't we just print that return same visual execution little more efficient those are function definitions in bro those are the three forms you commented on the answer is probably if there is so, this function maybe your standards for coding apply to bro don't overthink this if it is very clean crisp code it's very obvious the rules of the day always applies don't over comment that's her function definition for pro effectively the three forms I'll show you just one more just so it is absolutely obvious and this one is going to take one string no returned I use we know that because one ARG comma S1 here I want that way we now covered by and large all formats the one-armed and we know that because we we had hidden the extra which really is upset before we should do that for all of these all we Know calling what and we don't have to anytime you're riding in Prince there debug buy large and you don't want to have to think about it throwing it so there we at we know who's calling what who's returning one who's printing it so we can run down the nice thing is to when you add in that little bit of extra key bug information into your friends leave them on you can trace them down quick then otherwise discrepancy if you're

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/bro/debug-logs.org:2: other logs of interest in bro sounds a bit nebulous because there's if you're loading up everything out there there's virtually infinite number of logs that you could generate especially with the now the knowledge of filtering these are the standard ones were looking to look at the ones that already exist the ones you can enable usually be a very simple policy script being loaded they have a lot of purpose of around them for debugging for profiling for statistics analysis and ingestion capture laws to figure out if lost my are you might feel like any of them you when kind of analysis of the fact that you are losing data maybe you're running bro control and looking at some things but this will give you a how to enable and disable these things to be able to look at them and understanding debug your in the field and also in development clearland show me the profile of a prophet log this turns on profiling upper resource consumption profiling statistics and you simply at load policy Miss profiling. Bro and you'll have the profile the prophet log generated this will work and try bro this works otherwise now what I caveat a bit the use cases troubleshooting a sensor to turn resource balance boundary issues that you're running out of resources but enabling this profiling log if you're really near the edge of your resource usage and you're getting lucky and you have sized your sensor just right and you didn't add in the extra you know 20% 30% Spike possibility have your networks never doing that your calculations were brilliant put you over the edge though is then trying to profile it because they is going to keep more data accumulating in memory send it out from there so it's a good and bad thing is a double-edged sword you need to know that it'll help balance it out maybe you turned on your Center crashes because you're right at the edge of your memory usage on that sensor. And you're not running swap for performance reasons om killer kicks in and Nails bro takes it out at least you should hopefully have a couple profile log entries to be able to look at and then realize enable this script that is a huge lesson to learn and Broward General you are often times very much okay until you enable the latest script and you wind it back one your gunt this is where I come in to say that I should have said repeatedly throughout the course use a source code repository of some kind Version Control your bro Scripts I'll save you much time and even worse you should not use this on a production sensor at all times you can enable it from time to time if you're really trying to track things advantages you'll get a lot of data disadvantages production sensor and then you have to stop at eventually disable this log and then started again so that's a lot of bouncing of your sensor Michelle I recommend that SL as you may have within your organization externally that may not even be feasible keep that in mind and plan accordingly in the end and use it accordingly should be part of a bassline exercise before a sensor deployment so Baseline understanding of Hardware episode VM otherwise of your network and what it looks like a bro and it feels like coming out of logs it should be a good Baseline exercise and then turn it off and production every once in a while maybe you keep a sensor that has a t of your production data that you can enable and disable to profile in real time that day to maybe get an exact if you have infinite resources and time that's brilliant way to Bill to do things it's it the resources as the cumbersome almost more than time depending on your network the capture Lost Locke alright this is the diff definition this script log evidence regarding the degree to which the packet capture process efforts from measurement loss from measure effective are measurable lost lost Scooby-Doo to overload on the host or Nick performing the package Hampshire or it could even be beyond the host if your caption from a switch with the span Port it's very possible this is something I really want to make emphasis of that's a switch to self could be overloaded and dropping packets Asus computer in terms of the number of Gap events acts for sequence number that's above Gap lessons to be learned here or go above and beyond the capture loss log when bro is struggling it's not always bro it's not always your sensor Hardware it could have occurred well Upstream as alluded to hear span ports tendency to overload because of the Asic in the way the mesh works in the switches they are copying things a CPU is actually running hot because it's not going actually through the Asic is going through the CPU and out that specific port is burning up lots of clocks apples copying that data letting the Asics take care of topping it's appropriate ports across the bus of a switch that's why that occurs that will occur special on a saturated networking when you were especially see it is on a network much like the profiling log but in the network side of things when you are just at the edge of your available resources you enable a span port especially during peak times of network usage going to blow over the top of your span port and you're going to start it's going to switch is going to go into save itself mode and for the span Port it's going to just dropped packets because the CPUs busy otherwise to be aware that if you don't see data there's a reason and a lot of times it is upstream and if you have a means of sampling on that Network outside of your sensor I recommend doing so just to see if there's any kind of capsule lost look your switch does your switch give any kind of statistics on loss of transfer dropped packets or anything like that if so the Smoking Gun is Upstream off your sensor is still possibly and coming up on you to fix it or pull up roses solution at least but at least you have support those claims and that is the capture lost block much like the previous profiling log you just simply load the policy script and then it'll be in able to be written down to capture underscore lost along and you can begin parsing it from there it should not be used all the time my high-bandwidth networks it comes down that resource usage to you until you care how many packets you lose or do you care that somebody enabling something you may lose more packets for me and I think most folks that use bro is sick worrying about losing more packets it's a network if it is a saturated enough Network enough data flowing bro is going to going to suffer a few losses you're going to lose some data and that's never good and no one ever wants to hear that I load saying it but that's the reality you're going to lose some data plan accordingly work accordingly and you'll be fine it's it's not the end of the world there always be some more data if something is truly malicious on your network and that you're so concerned if they're on your network you're going to see them again they're going to be there for a while and honestly for span Port is Stephanie's white-hot from earring data and that's knew that might be in itself be worth investigating perhaps not malicious but something on your networks changed and be aware of that resource statistics the stats. Log improved greatly into 5 and will be ensuring and proved more moving forward I bet this logs memory packing and log statistics elac statistics the amount of time it takes to actually write out a log mixing austrians a log and lag but you simply loaded it's a policy scripted you just load like the capture loss and the profiling it may be used on high-bandwidth networks I have personal experience with this log it is it will not bug you down too much if all is kind of a similar idea to some stats framework where it'll login epic of data and then flush it out it will work just fine on a headband with network and honestly it is a great way to get the data off it is superior to if you're used if you're any running bro in a used to using the pro control statistics and pulling down those stats log is definitely less overhead and more efficient and more effective I'm doing it otherwise so I recommend migrating to that approach and and I been with networks all the ones I've been I use it on occasion on daily and that's many of them you might run into very special edge cases where it doesn't work well it only doesn't work well because of resources and that may not because the box is in the provision Too Well Done Network may just be that severe Alabama in that saturated but this is definitely one of the non-standard enable logs I recommend enabling and profiling your sensor and understanding how much data it is using how much resources are being consumed by it and then using the data Downstream to use as a health check otherwise it's a very helpful log and then you're against us to statistics can serve as a baseline for understanding resources requirements overtime use that as your Baseline use that as your ongoing generation maybe you're going to put it in a croissant or something like that and log those statistics overtime and in take a good hard look at how your Center works and and go from there maybe you shouldn't get additional behavior in your network as a side effect so if you suddenly start seeing spikes and the memory the packet in the lag statistics that is in itself in indicator anything bad this early indicator of something going on this different is changed otherwise been there since Baseline take that for what it is and use it use that as a means of writing some notices writing smoke alarms for house maybe you're going to intercept the stats login filter those and Firearm there brought you to look at Upstream if you have multiple sensors deployed you can use it as a means of correlating date of there to keep that in mind and maybe they may be very specific attacks a very specific resource usage and one location than another or you might find out that you have a distributed denial-of-service across your infrastructure and various disjoint locations which by and large would be a fairly sophisticated service for most companies big or small so that's something to definitely be concerned with and look at and with that that is additional logs of Interest they are every useful and ever expanding and ever being optimized I would assume that in the future there will be a few more like this who was bro but at this point they throw these three years together inappropriately give you very interesting insights of your sensorstat salt log is especially useful and in my experience and especially if you get it off your sensor in an expeditious fashion either streaming it via one of them alternate writers or logstash off or otherwise that then you can take that day to distill it and look at it super interesting is when you have disjoint sensors across an organization or disparate locations that you can then look at and analyze Peaks and valleys of data over time in your organization can you have statistical information there if you start seeing the bell curve up daily bandwidth how much of those can you make a Venn diagram of the the bell curves of your daily statistics she's me up Network usage using the stats log across your Enterprise very interesting research thing and something that might actually yield some very interesting results

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/osquery/1.2-join.org:2: if you recall from the previous lesson our goal for that lesson in this lesson was to list all local groups for specific user in this case my user on Mac and part one was to get these ready for the which is 501 the second one was to filter the user underscore group table by user ID we did that by selecting user id id from the user group table where the user ID equals 5 of one and I got us the result on the right-hand side unfortunately we don't typically memorize group names based on group IDs and so we need to do something else to actually replace with group names Square part 3 joining comes in we're going to join you're under scripts able to get that group name what about joining joining allows us to combine Rose from two or more tables that share a similar column we will slice and dice process system we will be joining the processes table with a number of other tables because they all share the same column the process ID they're two different types of joints that are relevant for us which is the default join and left join you can see from the Shaded diagrams from each table that have matches in the similar column showing combines all the records on the left table with matching records on the right table does not have a corresponding match in the right and Nola's use instead talking about this probably doesn't help much but let's look at a couple examples let's go back to the query we've been working on we want to join the group table so that we can get that group name instead of the group ID these two tables you see that there is a shared column group ID so we should be able to join these easily using a query like this select columns explicit about what tables those columns come from select the group from The Crucible next up is from the group stable and we're going to join inner-join user on a square group table using the group ID as a share column results are the user underscore groups. User ID equals 501 keep in mind we're being explicit where the user ID column on user on the score groups equals 501 so once we run that then we get a nice-looking name here for the group ID on left hand side and the corresponding name to the group so that is a join for the fur goal for being able to find the groups that my user user ID 501 is a part of how to do a demo and look as an example of another join but this time using listening ports so this time I want to show the difference between the inner join and left join where to start out with a simple query that selects the process ID and the name from the processes table as you can see there are quite a few processes right what we want to do is we want to know if any of these processes have any are our listing for any incoming connections if they have a listening port on the system do that by joining it with Imports table okay to say select or unique listing for stop ports and process friendly processing inner join listening ports the PID using that share column which is the SSID let's go ahead and run this will see that there are indeed some some processes that have listening ports the zero is relevant in this case there's some hidden information that sometimes we can select that it would make more sense the point is that we definitely are processes that have a match in the other table in the listening ports table when we change this to a left join let's see what happens I just changed it to left join and we'll see that there are now there are all the results from the process to table right cuz if you look back at the query were saying show me all of the results all the rows in the process of table no matter if they don't have a corresponding a match in the right table and listening ports table there isn't a match put no one there PVC a bunch of nose right here so these are don't have any matching or corresponding data in the and listening ports table okay again remember that the inner join is the default join so if you just say join it's going to be an inner join okay let's take a look at one final example parts of were back at hoes Corey I promise and I'm listening look at the logged-in users table okay we say slick star from logged-in users so this table shows us all of the users I have an active session on the system you can see with the type column that there are some inactive sessions the user and then you see dead the user name the TTY time and then PID now it would be pretty interesting if we could join the process table with this table using the PID column to see what processes of these login sessions are associated with so I've two questions for you blocking users and the process of table using the PID what kind of join should we should we use should it be an inner join or less chewing cable should be on the left side if we all live all we want to do is see this information with the process name and the process path what should we do okay I'm going to pause this or let's try that again let's have you pause it and take a minute and think through which kind of joining should be and which tables should be on the left okay we're back now while you pause it I went and grab some coffee so I we should be ready to go let's take a look at what I join would look like I'm using a left join so walking through this query we say select a logged-in users. Types of the type column the user column the TTY and the PID columns from the logged-in users table and then the process name we're just going to the process name from the process of table from processes so where were saying at least for the square that the process is going to be on the left side left join logged-in users on the process of that PID and logging uses have PID what happens if so we get we get the information we're looking for so we have the concessions associated with the the process things but will scan other information not really not really what we want we just want these that's because we're using that left join people that query backup remember so we have the process of table on the left or saying left joins were saying join all of the records from the processes table with logged in users whether or not there is a match you know whether or not there's corresponding data and then just put Knowles for the rest and so that's what we see there so let's try this now instead of a okay inner join and it's looking much better inner join now it's only going to show us the record matching values between two columns the PID columns except you'll notice that we don't see the inactive session we only the active user so let's do one more query this time we're going to do summer going to do a left join swappa tables we're going to put princesses on the rights princesses on the rights alright that's makes sense so processes okay and what we've done here in this is our final query is that we change it to a left join and we put the logged-in users on the left so we're saying select all the records from logged-in users join it with the processes and if there's no corresponding record with the processes table just go ahead and print the Knoll which is what you see here and we could throw path on there and I would see a lot more information right is the differences again between the election and the inner join left table right table and just another example so that ends are on joining I completely understand if you still have some questions about joins I definitely can be very confusing I'm we have a lab or two for you to go through a please also ask questions if you run into issues
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/osquery/1.1-filtering.org:2: parcel next couple lessons it'll show you how we're going to be using filtering and joining okay so the big picture is that we went to list all the local groups for specific user in this case Meyers RJ Brower too much sense at first don't worry I'll explain in more in-depth in this listen and the next lesson first so we have to start out with selecting the username userid shell from users table because we need to find what my user ID is and you can see that at the very bottom ERJ Prowler my user ID is 501 so next we want to go ahead and select the user ID the group ID from the user group table where the user ID is my ID 501 this is great right it's exactly what we're after all the groups for my user it's not very readable right now we would rather have a group name rather than that look at the group table and see what we have group name from groups right so there's all of the group IDs on the left and the group names on the right so if we can actually join if we can join a couple tables here than we can get all of the group IDs and the group names for my group what this last query is we're going to join the group group table which we just saw and the user group stable and that gives us a nicely list of the group names of all the groups that I am a part of this is the big picture and the going to be breaking out over this lesson this one we talked about filtering as well as joining let's start out with filtering when dealing with large tables we need to figure out how to construct the queries in a way that allows us to return a more manageable results this is where filtering comes into play operators allow us to refine the data that were clearing for so that we get that men's will results you can see there are quite a few operators here we have the equal to not equal less than less than or equal greater than greater than or equal and then between and like in detail and look at how we can use them practically scary to get that more manageable results and we're clearing larger hose query tables where the evil operator it actually seen the evil Operator just a minute ago when we were doing the demo we did a select user ID group ID from the user group stable user ID equals 5 semicolon in where Clause is the different clause say where the user ID which is my user id equals 501 this grouping right looking at the opposite of the equal to is not equal to we can use this in a query like this we say these select username shell from the users table where the shell does not equal a string user been false Sims 4 Mac OS where go ahead and filter out all of the users that have a bin false shell which could interesting insight into what users actually have a illegitimate shell on the system this case just a few for as he has 5 results are including my I'm in that is the not equal to operator now we have the less than and greater than sets we can use this in a query like so select username userid from the users table where the user ID is greater than 500 on a Mac OS system typically system accounts are less than 500 and so again this would be interesting query that might give us some insight into what user accounts are non-system accounts are on the system running this gives us the following results in the username of Jay Brower and nobody with the user ID so that is a greater than all the rest the less than or equal greater than greater than the between operator operator allows us to see between a particular range inclusive looking at a query we say select username userid user ID is between 100 and 500 inclusive part means that we are including any users that have user ID of 100 or 500 I seen before ordered by the user ID columnist what that means is that allows us to sort the results is there ID column ascending we go ahead and run the square eat get the username on the left username on the right and it's sorted by user ID ascending finally the like operator this is one of my favorites as you'll find yourself using it quite a bit in OS query operator allows us to do pattern searching with wildcard the two wild cards that are available are the percent sign and the underscore % is zero one or multiple characters and the underscore just as an H1 Single Character first example here select username userid from the users table where the username like % at admin % finishes query what we're saying is username that includes chapman and anything before or anything after it's so what that gives us is username with some interesting looking usernames what's going on with that K Edmund unsquare change password it's definitely check into okay now our second example is going to get a little more complicated here we're going to say select username userid from users where the username and said of life we're saying not like and then we have some gobbledygook here okay let's break this down so on Mac OS system there are many system accounts that are pre pended with the underscore character find any counselor in the system underscore unfortunately for us the underscore is a wildcard character so we need to find a way to escape that that's what the Escape Clause does at the very end there it says that any character after the backslash treat that character as literal okay so when you have that not like we say not like Escape character underscore so we're now now we're saying wild card so that's our one car % this is saying select and users where the username does not have an underscore at the very beginning all right what it gets us all the users on the system that does not start with an underscore hopefully these two example give you an idea of how powerful and flexible the like filter is so that was a quick look at filtering operators with in SQL the equal than not equal the less than and greater than sets between and like remember that when you're trying to query tables you definitely will be in some cases where there's just too much data to quickly and easily look through it using filtering gives us the ability to refine and results operators that you can use these are just some of the more common ones that you'll run into next lesson will pick up on looking at joining
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/osquery/1.0-basic.org:2: Construct basic queries to get data out of those tables we need to touch on something that has tripped up quite a few newcomers to the OS queer community and or Square D what was Prairie IAC interactive shell of os query table comes out and you're trying to figure out what queries you want to run across your entire infrastructure I was correct I would be what you would use that for system copy to local system drop into the interactive shell and you can spend some time explaining the system figuring out what's going on with it what Square D on the other hand is he dating component of owls query you use it for scheduling queers across your infrastructure to track state changes over time you would be running I was pretty as a demon I'm across tens or hundreds of your systems it would connect back to the management server that we're going to be talking about in another module and that management server will be what's going to be sending it the configuration for what queers the schedule where to send the logs and things like that is that there is no connection or shared resources between OS query I and O Square D free I to a query the old Square D database connection now interesting know if they are actually the same binary if you rename most demon mode in two separate Moe's interactive shell and the demon mode use Osprey I to interact with the Daemon in anyway there's no connection between the two again it's one of those things that a trip up newcomers talk about tables tables are an integral part of a database and a query is no exception find information about the current tables for osquery is on the website I was crazy. IO / schema you'll see something like this this is a snippet of the system underscore info table description underneath that is system information for identification upper right-hand corner that this different platforms at this table is relevant for this case Mac OS Linux windows and the vsts next up we have the columns names the column type and a description of the column no at the current time there are 200 plus tables available for osquery and there are more being added on a regular basis just to take some time go to the website and see what's available usually filter by platform as well as always crave version and so you can really look in detail at the political platform that you're interested in and what you might be able to query for that particular platform send text perspective as queer use a sequel light and so most of the functionality you find in SQL I you'll be able to use within OS query look at a very basic query getting two more dance craze in next couple but we should always start with the basics so we have these select keyword to select whose name uuid columns the system underscore info table semi colon is important that makes it clear that your query is complete or at the very end right so once we hit enter on that here is a result we can't host name JB - Mac and the unique ID for the system this lesson with a demo of the oskari I shell as well play some tables and some basic okay so here I am at my terminal I already have those crazy installed so I'm going to run sudo always Creek by to drop into the interactive shell oarfish is with an elevated command prompt or Powershell session in order to access those cables on those query that require that level of permissions will see that we get a new shell here if you recall I most Curry is based on super light and so we have SQL Lite shell commands stuff with you. Help that shows us all the up he's one of the most important ones right off the bat is exit she'll be simply just by doing. Exit or quit and you're out next up will get a little more little more difficult from their next up is we want to see what tables are available to query on our system as well as for our version of osquery soap running three to six tables that's going to list all the tables that are available for us to query with his version as well as his platform that were on can see when I scroll up there is quite a few tables at 4 one in particular we want to do some sort of crap and so we can actually do. Tables and then the key word I'm looking for something related to users I can do that tables username tables to look at I can go. Schema and that will show me the scheme of the particular columns this allows me easily if I do is Select what's select the user ID username Michelle from the users Caesar's table and there are all of our users okay now as we've discussed previously there are some tables that irrelevant only for particular platforms and so let's see if we can find one for Mac iMac does have a feature called keeper ahead and search. Tables for anything with the word gate in it you see that there are two tables now we can look at schema or we could just go ahead and say select homes from gate now fortunately there is tab completion so we can select gate keeper and we have our table name they're already laid out for us you know what I forgot I forgot to say from select star drum words with lots of Dana but unfortunately, it's not very readable in this format right just too much too much line rapping there so let's change the output mode through. Mode and change that to line rerun that query and we can see that there's still some wrapping but it's a bit more easier to read in this output mode things that back by going to. Mode machines at to line rerun that right just too much too much line wrapping their I forgot to say from Flagstar table price of Pasadena but unfortunately, it's not very readable and this format right just too much too much line rapping there so let's change the output mode through. Mode and change that to line rerun that query and we can see that there's still some rapping but it's a bit more easier to read in this output mode change that back by going to. Mode and pretty rerun that query in your back do the output mode we were in man I love to dude help put to Json so I can more easily imported into some other tools I use let's go ahead and try mode Json and unfortunately line list and pretty if we drop out of the shell we can run over screen on interactively and output as Json how to do that we're going to do sudo OS for you are query query in a single quotes and then dash dash json as is and then - - chiasson what that does okay and tomorrow in two more end up carrying in the next couple lessons
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/syslog.org:2: That will take a quick look at the fast logging format does the human-readable text-based format they'll be familiar to those that if you snort the past by default what is limited to logging alerts only a quick look here by default if named fast out log other stuff I only has two entries in it start with the timestamp followed by the signature ID signature message for event message application protocol some port and destination address is this logo put is very similar to fast Al-Aqsa syslog instead of a file is important to note that uses the system logging service rather than sending directly to remote syslog server sale by default show where it's turned on that's open that circotic Refrigeration file here that's under the outputs section with a key name of syslog and search for it with Dash slug will see it's enabled or disabled by default change it to yes has a few other areas just love parameters you can change if necessary that will take a look at the unified to alert output unified to as an alert only binary output primarily used for integrating with tools designed to work with snorts unified to Output before we can use the unified to out but we have to enable in the configuration file find it by searching for unified 2 and then just said no to yes there are a few other options are quite similar to start unified to Output that you can change if needed but for now we'll stick with the defaults LOL run suricata against the test my IDs pcap file I'll take a moment to run and we should say Unified to alert file right here view it with a storage unit you to spew food tool stairways the Advent record followed by a packet record another event record and final packet record the TLs log has a legacy format for logging TLS certificate metadata to a log file as TLS certificate metadata is also love to Eve let's hope what has been disabled by default well now and able to sell put in and take a look at its format the first we will have to turn on in the configuration file can find a buyer looking for TLS - log disabled so I'll turn it on leave the other settings at their default for now we will now run suricata over a pcap containing a TLS certificate should see a TLS. Log file to see right here will take a quick look at its format simplifile we have the time stamp address and Port destination address and port and the details of the certificate itself such as the subject in the common name in this case this pcap contained a request to the Google homepage the TLs store is used to log actual TLS certificates to files naked Scene It will not one file containing a certificate in another file containing information about the certificate in plain text Works in combination with a TLS. required to trigger the actual logging of a certificate as a TLS store is a disabled by default we will first find it by looking for TLS Dash store the first will turn it on now that does log2 files / certificate might want to sit the certificate login directory uncommon the default location just starts which would be the directory certs under / bar / logs Plattsburgh Canada and as I said you do need a rule Apple rule the very simple rule that will match on any TLS packet and here is the TLs. Store keyword that will trigger the logging to a file now that's runs her cat I using this rule file over a pcap file known to contain a certificate 2 - s parameter will just use a single profile alright log directory see the certs directory and two files she is the dot metafile which contains metadata about the certificate very similar to the information you would see logged in the TLs - log or is the TLs event in the E fog now the other file. Pam is content format look similar to certificates you would use in a web server

/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/osin.gpl.org:6: pretty pretty good let me take a look at the virtual machine that we will use for the suricata online training exercises and Labs were sitting here at the login prompt as the OSF user we can log in with the password of suricata and all lower case now we are at the desktop here will do is go ahead and poke around her home directory and see what we have here I said the Terminator show one of the things I like about this as we can split the show sing me need so you can right-click and split horizontally split vertically I will probably use that in just a bit here home directory couple folders that we care about the exercises exercises we have distinctive. Rules file all the rules that we write we have these Siri. Sh file and that is the first by what they look at this is a very simple script to kind of need in writing signatures and testing them over and over and over again check to see if the directory then make a new directory an old friend suricata not checking checksums little read in the PCAT that's given to it as the first argument and it'll log out all of its files to / 10/13 blessing here was print out the best one distinctive. Rules files is just simply World writer rolls keep keep in mind that file in exercises HP caps here Venice is where we'll start our exercises
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/osin.gpl.org:8:* What's rule
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/osin.gpl.org:9: hello everyone my name is Jason I like to welcome you to the rule fundamentals and IDs deployment module in this module we will be talking about what goes into a certain kind of rope guess what it is what it does and why we care so much about the we will get into the fundamentals of writing rules starting from the most basic building blocks and work our way from understanding to writings options we can include norville's to better detectable we are trying to find about the same time hopefully preventing false positives will getting to the metadata of a rule so that when you or someone else in your team looks back on the roll a year do understand your intentions when you wrote it getting to some light pcre don't click out of the training yet I promise it'll be okay troubleshooting strategies as reading and testing rules can sometimes be a painstaking process deployment sections about some ideas nodes and will end with the lab so let's get going what is a rule attic and generate metadata about protocols such as HTP and DNS on its own construct the engine to look for specific markers and network traffic what about if they are most commonly we think of malicious Network traffic when we are writing rules but this is not always the case anything that can give me additional what's going on with my network call my network alerts to help me tell the story of an incident that I will of course write a rule for that hot new Trojan command-and-control traffic that is generated from the most vicious in but I also want to write a rule to look for the Dynamic DNS domains that are I also would write rules on any interesting or abnormal HP post traffic that can indicate similar activity this way when the authors of the Mauer change the checking pattern on the Trojan my signature may miss on that part but I will have lots of other alerts around it to help tell the story radio rules of ultimate art form the freedom to get creative and how you want to write your rule follow that will make your rolls efficient and clean rules are written in a simple language that instructs the sensor to login alert to the configure interroll you will specify multiple contents that should all be present in what is essentially a big and statement before this will be somewhat of a familiar concept if he's written store trolls before the con the syntax will be very similar Source Four rules can come from anywhere Dauphin first found on blogs and tweets someone find something delicious and share it with the world Network component to it and we can record them our talking in a packet capture it is important to remember that as he write rules and apply them on sensors each rule takes away a little bit of available memory and Flash or CPU guidelines to follow will help to ensure that you are writing rules in an efficient manner that will keep your sensor from getting too bogged down with poorly written here's the basic conceptual structure of suricata IDs rule from a very high level expand on each of these items in the next few slides the first part of the rule is the header we want the real tabs along with what protocol suricata should expect this world to be found it who's a pair of eye peas Imports and has an arrow indicating directionality the second portion of the rule highlighted in blue indicates the real message and contents 2% of the analyst review in the logs contents are the portions of the traffic we that we have Dean critical to Detective to learn on the last part of the rule in reddish-orange there is the rule metadata also keep track of various aspects of the role near updating troubleshooting or deploying rules each of the sections understand what each one is starting off with the rule action Direction tells a story about an engine what you want to do with this rule should the contents of it match the options are as follows generating alert and log matching packets let the traffic through log will just log the traffic and not generating alert password nor the packet and allow it through if an IPS mode drop will drop the packet can also send TCP reset packets to the originator of the connection the action of reject both IDs and IPS notes that's the first thing we put in our rule typically roll start off as alert in an IPS deployment you may end up switching your Al and if you actively want to deny traffic and IPS or IDs mode you may end up using reject moving on to the protocol suricata has the ability to detect specific protocols declared by the rule writer tcp udp icmp IP SMB DNS among others use the protocol you need in your rule if it's available you're writing a rule on some HP traffic use the HTTP protocol little protocol decoder for the crafty or writing a rule for you UDP or IP that is the second element in a row header no we have to declare some hosting Port values the way you have to declare the directionality of the traffic Williamsport variables that are configurable by the Third Kind of dog this big file contains defaults but double check them to make sure that they are appropriate for your environment the two most common variables and X HomeNet often were first intro networks or whatever you are protecting with the sensor external that is usually classified as anything that is not home yet there are other variables here such as HTP servers SMTP servers or you can even make your own variables for using your rules if you want to specify a single IP or range of ips here in between the two IP port pairs is an arrow directionality example shows traffic from the monitor Network second example shows traffic from the external network to the monitor Network you can also write bi-directional rules but we don't recommend it unless you really need to as this causes double the traffic to be inspected by the roll slowing down your sensor what was the host we have the port Port always follows the host value in the header declare the party was traffic for this world will be evaluated use any to indicate that this traffic could occur on any port but sometimes we want to be specific our first example here will alert on TCP traffic from remonter Network on any port to the escrow Network report 9003 like the host variables Portsmouth variables as well such as HTTP ports SMTP ports FTP ports cetera these are configurable in the yellow file and you can make your own variables if you need to Port City indicated by placing a bang in front of the port number Port values can be expressed in other various ways I need the number to describe a single port such as their first example here of Port 80 we can express multiple ports by wrapping brackets around a comma-separated group of ports we can express our range of ports by wrapping brackets around a colon separated pair of numbers we can get fancy music combination of ports example says we are looking for traffic sourcing former monitor network with any port above 1024 for the Extranet on Port 8800 between 6667 and 6680 6679 so you can get pretty creative let's do a few group exercises take a look at the highlighted packets in this Wireshark image how to fill in the blanks here sure to use variables with default values when you see the dollar sign the concept we're not diving super deep into the network information so you may have different answers or not enough information is given to make a sound informed adult decision nothing here is going into production just yet feel free to pause the video if you want to try and figure it out so we know that we are ready and alert role need to enter in the protocol value tells us that this is HDPE so that's pretty straightforward we would use HTTP protocol The Source address rfc1918 to the privately assigned addresses that are defined as HomeNet in the default suricata configuration will be the variable home net as for the port since we have no idea what port the machine would choose to talk on so we put any as the value here we can see that we are making a get request to the server so the right facing Arrow nation is an external IP so we will use that very we talked about earlier start on that Nation chorus 80 which is commonly used to be flexible is protocol detection to ensure that we are looking at 8 so we put any here it should look like this hopefully that makes sense let's do another example the video and figure it out we are again looking at the packet highlighted in blue again we're reading alert roll and we need first decide what protocol we are using click anything I recognize and Wireshark BP is a protocol see that the handshakes took place in the first three packets in the capture calls identified by Wireshark is TCP again we're looking at rfc1918 address as our source so we make use of our home net variable again we can't be sure the source part so we use any Nation looks like an external address roulette there in the port seems to be a very high uncommon port typical usage for the port the for this example we would just use any information here here so we could use as our glider that's example see if you can fill in the blanks right away we can see that we are looking at DNS traffic here Wireshark tells us in the critical columns or protocol will be DNS our source appears to be internal net on any port to any host on any port why you would choose any here for the destination host some networks have internal DNS resolvers I want to roll out that traffic if we specified external net false negative alerts on a roll without us knowing we choose any of the destination for it and let suricata handle determining what is and isn't enough traffic they'll do it for the rule header you should understand how that works the next portion of the rule the world message
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/eve.org:2: You put silencer catalogs alerts that is detected along with additional information such as Network flows and DNS requests first we will go over where to find the outputs then we will dive into Eve the recommended up but for most Academy users finally we will do an overview of the other available outputs moster cat installations will store the log files in / bar / log / terracotta this is location used by the Debian and RPM packages as well as a location used in the Cirque attic installation guides I love directory can also be set on the command line capture files and you wish to have the log files placed in your working directory or some other location the like directory can reset the configuration file with the default lockdir option take a quick view of the log files are default installation we're going to find the log files in / bar / log / turketta Solutions such as this one the log directory has restricted permissions before that what you switch to root try again I hear we see the three log files attorney Able by default versus the eve. Jason or recommended up with these days fast out log which is a text-based format that'll be familiar to snort users and stats log which is the human-readable statistics what's going on inside cercana the Evo put Hustler referred to as Json logging is a flagship feature acercado short for JavaScript
/Users/gtrun/org-notes/course/suricata/eve.org:4: check notation is a file format that is both human-readable and easily Parts by most programming languages many tools can consume Json logstash making it very easy to store and analyze events something like that yolk Sac is just an acronym that refers to the combination of elasticsearch logstash and Cabana no this is Eric at his best out but it does require the Janson live terracotta otherwise it will be built without support for you however I'll Prevail packages include the support even extensible format providing unified feet of a variety of event types these types include alerts question responses similar to what you might see in a DNS requests and responses certificate metadata on TLS connections a data profile seen on supportive protocols packets when running an IPS mode email metadata for messages sent over SMTP SSH connection data such as client and server software and versions internal suricata statistics flow records a more traditional netflow like record with unidirectional flow logging and D MP3 and Industrial control protocol new types can be added an existing pipes can be improved without breaking compatibility with other tools the evil put can also be sent to different destinations including files which is the default syslog Unix sockets and redis for not familiar with red is it is an in-memory database that can also be used as a message broker however support for redness is not built by default JQ is a command line tool to help manually process Json files it can be particularly useful when working with Eve. Json files on the command line described as a tool like said talking crap but specifically for Json most Linux distributions and should be easily installable with app get yum or Brew on the back we will now take a look at a neat. Json file with the help with haq tool for this demonstration of using an eve. Json that was populated with events from a few different Peak apps in order to show a variety of event types so as we can see here I haven't Eve. Json file it is pretty large 23 megabytes we will take a quick look at it with less first so you can see here on the first line we have the object just a timestamp field flow ID so on an event type of http hi II record has another Revenge Type of HTTP and then here we have a file in for record typical you're going to have many non alert records such as HDPE DNS typically have another being triggered information so this is where that JQ tool comes it comes in handy so if you want to filter out just alert events we can cat the event. Json file to Jake you want to see how we're going to select for the event type equals alert that's also has the benefit of colorizing you'll put for you let's just look at the last line here we have a I reckon that starts with a timestamp the flow ID before I D helps you correlate what event against other events that happened on the same flow the pcap count which is the packet number within the pcap file that triggered the alert it should correlate with the same packet number when looking at the capture file in Wireshark we got our event type which is the alert Source IP Source Port destination IP protocol having a subject alert with us Pacific's of the other details I'm action to Loudon at IDs motor everything's going IPS mode that my baby dropped generator ID which is always 1/4 cercado signature revision the signature description or message the category or the severity mjq is also able to pretty print this easier on the eyes just remove the mitasie honestly just look at the last one it's all broken out at least you to look at I'll also take a quick look at a TLS event so just change the event type 2 Cialis and here we can see you record from a connection to Google will not take a quick look at an SSH event so just sent type SSH we can see if you record Siri look at the first one got the timestamp in the flow ID account event type SSH connection details at the source IP fishing IP destination port Proto then we got the SSH subject to subject which gives us information on the client are using J2 we could JQ we can just break out the SSH object so if that type of service like that event type ssage and then we'll just have it print out the SSH object here we go there we can see it easier rundown of the software versions and use another interesting event to look at or DNS records princess filter of genus Regal the first one we have the usual Eve feels like time stamp photo ID a source and destination pre-orders and then we have the DNS record this was a query the query ID was 36146 the request was for www www. Org and I was a request for an a record and here we have the response the answer the ID matches up so we know this is a an answer to that request respond with the c name of certain kind of Dash ids.org and then the following records are just the NBA results for that see name as you can see the EVAP
